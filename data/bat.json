The state witnessed the highest number of chil dren trafficked within India in the year 2016 2. Additionally, \nthe National Family Health Survey Report-V shows that nearly 48% of rural girls in West Bengal are married off before reaching adulthood. West Bengal also ranks high among the child \nlabour-prone states of India. As per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2021, the state is in the 4 th position for various forms of crimes against children. Hence, working for child \nprotection in this state is essential. \n \n \n2 https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/west-bengal-records-highest-number-of-human-trafficking-cases-in-2016-1782177  \nWest Bengal also faces a complex set of poverty and developmental challenges that demand careful attention and strategic plan ning. We specifically chose to focus on the five districts \nmentioned earlier due to their high rates of child rights violations as per the NCRB, high rate of school dropouts (UDISE data) and government recommendations during our engagement \nwith government stakeholders. \n \nThe following are the common issues prevalent across the five districts selected under this programme: \n \n\u2022 High vulnerability: West Bengal is the fourth most populous state in India with a population of 97.7 million, a fifth of which are poor. A substantial portion of its populace comprises \nof children. Several of these children are often victims of abuse, exploitation, neglect and violence within their own families, schools, and communities. Vulnerability to various forms of \ndeprivation such as poverty, malnutrition, safe shelter, lack of access to education, etc. affect many children in these four districts. \n \n\u2022 Child rights violations: Various forms of child rights violations persist, such as child marriage, child trafficking, child sexual abuse and child labour across these four districts. It is \nimperative to focus on addressing these issues within these districts to safeguard children from harm, prevent their exploitation, and facilitate their growth, wellbeing, and participation \nin India\u2019s development story. \n \n\u2022 Development challenges: The districts  of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Murshidabad , and North  24 Parganas also grapple  with a multitude  of socio-economic challenges, \ncharacterised by restricted availability of basic services such as healthcare, early childhood care & development, and employment opportunities for vulnerable households.  \n \n\u2022 Education and awareness: Numerous children in West Bengal lack access to high -quality and equitable education. This factor coupled with poor school facilities results in high child \ndropout rates, especially among the girls from marginalised communities. According to government data, West Bengal was among the dozen -odd states that had secondary school \ndropout rates higher than the national average of 14.6% in 2022.  \n \nHence, undertaking a comprehensive education, child protection and social protection initiative across these 5 districts is i mperative given the heightened vulnerability of children. \nCollaborating closely with both government authorities and local communities will enable us to attain success in safeguarding children and fostering their comprehensive development. \nThis approach aims  to shield them from economic and social hardships while facilitating their access to essential services such as healthcare with focus on mental health services, \neducation, nutrition, and eventually ensuring their well-being. \n \nOver the last year, the programme spanned 6 districts and achieved the following:  \n \n\u2022 2,363 members of 94 collectives were made active. \n\u2022 336 children core group members (66% of target) emerged as active leaders on issues like gender equality, school enrolment etc. \n\u2022 In the newly added districts, 90 children\u2019s collectives have been formed till date. 2300 children between the age of 10-18 years are members of these collectives. \n\u2022 568 community-based institutions were made active of which 136 were VCPCs, 282 were SHGs, 42 were mothers\u2019 groups, 71 were parents' groups and 37 were local clubs. \n\u2022 In four districts, 136 VLCPCs have been formed and are monitored through regular updates and linkages to the various child protection agencies. \n\u2022 Partners also initiated community-based processes to identify and resolve child protection cases. So far, 229 cases (23.5% of those identified) have been resolved. \n\u2022 To reduce vulnerabilities of children, 131 dropout children have been re -enrolled in schools. Every month, 90% of the formed  VLCPCs have been meeting regularly to discuss child \nprotection issues. Some of the VLCPCs have also started taking independent actions where they have stopped child marriages and re -enrolled dropout children into schools. \n \nProject executive summary \nIn the upcoming year, our current strategy will primarily focus on prevention approaches; and derives from the critical learnings and achievements of the Prevention of Trafficking Model \nand our subsequent efforts in West Bengal. Therefore, our holistic programme model addresses  not only child trafficking but also other critical issues affecting the wellbeing of the \nvulnerable children and their families. It aims to systematically identify, reach, and empower most vulnerable communities in West Bengal to protect their children from various violations  \nof child rights. Given the concerning indicators regarding child protection, our initiative seeks to address the root causes of these violations and ensure that children are safe within their \ncommunities. \n \nDuring the gating period, the project will consolidate learnings so far to pilot a holistic model which will implement three critical interventions in the same community:  \n\u2022 Build economic resilience of vulnerable families through access to social security and livelihoods: By prioritising vulnerable families\u2019 access to social security schemes covering health, \nlivelihoods, education, we can address their basic needs. This will be done with support from District Child Protection Units (DCPUs) and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs).  We will \nalso link vulnera ble families at alternative livelihood options to increase household incomes.  Once the bare minimum is solved for, providing access to alternative livelihoods will \nhelp families build positive aspirations, complement their incomes, and minimise the risk of them turning to detrimental practices like child labour, child marriage, and child trafficking  \n\u2022 Using schools as safety nets and safe spaces: Safe and thriving learning environments indirectly mitigate risks of children falling into child labour, child marriage, and unsafe migration. \nThe project will undertake interventions to identify out of school children and ensure re -enrolment. All vulnerable children under the age o f 14 will be supported to continue in \nschool.  \n\u2022 Strengthening community and governance institutions for structural, local, and timely response to child protection issues. Th is will include a systematic mapping and identification \nof all vulnerable children in the intervention districts, which will form t he basis of tracking programme impact, success, and learnings.   \n \nOver the next year, we will identify additional capacity needs and partner with technical resource organisations to further enhance the capacities of our implementing organisations. \nThrough this collaborative endeavour, we hope to achieve our long -term objectives in child protection and community development within the seven blocks across the five selected \ndistricts. We will work closely with children, communities, and government systems. This holistic strategy will emphasise on prevention and community-level interventions and support. \nIt will involve engaging with children directly, empowering them with knowledge and skills to protect themselves and creating safe spaces for them to report any abuse or exploitation. \nAt the community level, our interventions will also play a pivotal role in raising awareness, sensitising families, and foste ring a culture of child protection. \n \nWe will also collaborate with government systems to ensure the best alignment of the policies and resources to effectively address the vulnerabilities of children and their families. \nThrough increased awareness, we will ensure mandatory reporting of cases of child abuse/ exploitation and subsequently facilitate enforcement of laws. By working closely with the PRI \nand block administration, we will ensure access to the social care and protection services. \n \nWe will also be working with survivors in the target locations to establish a robust survivors\u2019 network and will empower the survivors, enhancing their resilience to prevent re-trafficking \nand other forms of abuse and exploitation. This network will offer peer support to fellow survivors across the five districts and help to bring about systemic change. This approach ensures \nsustainability and the creation of a supportive ecosystem  for individuals who have endured similar forms of exploitation and abuse, fostering a safer and more compassionate \nenvironment for them. \n \nThe project is built on evidence from our past work and stakeholder engagement at the local level. On one hand, this ensures that our programme is informed by real time insights \ninto the impact of our work, while on the other, we are able to closely collaborate with the government to integrate best practices and scale up initiatives implemented by our partners \nin pilot villages. Through effective stakeholder engagement, we seek to institutionalise successful interventions and amplify  their impact. \n \nActivities to be undertaken under the project \nA) Vulnerability mapping and PRA  \n\u2022 Organise a Participatory Rapid Appraisal (PRA) exercise involving community members to identify hotspots of vulnerability.  \n\u2022 Engage community leaders, local organisations, and residents in discussions and activities to gain insights into key vulnerab ilities and risks. \n\u2022 Collaboratively identify areas within the community that are particularly vulnerable to various risks and hazards.  \n\u2022 Partner teams to conduct door-to-door mapping of households within identified hotspots, and collect data on households, including information on household composition, socio-economic \nstatus, and presence of at-risk children, education status etc \n\u2022 During the door-to-door mapping process, specifically identify and document households with at -risk children.  \n\u2022 Compile the data collected during the mapping exercise to create a comprehensive base document.  \n\u2022 Prioritise these hotspots based on factors such as socio-economic status, access to resources, and susceptibility to threats. \n\u2022 Establish a system for tracking at-risk children based on the data collected during the mapping exercise.  \n\u2022 Implement strategies to monitor the well-being and development of these children over time, ensuring they receive appropriate support and interventions.  \nB) Strengthening of institutions and community \n1.

Building upon successful strategies identified during this phase, we will implement changes at the division level, ensuring that interventions are effectively scal ed \nacross targeted districts and states. Through community ownership, government engagement, and capacity building efforts, we s eek to institutionalize best practices within the child \nprotection system, driving sustained improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and practices at both the grassroots and instituti onal levels. By gathering evidence for scaling up and fostering \npartnerships with key stakeholders, we aim to create lasting change and promote the well-being of children and families across our target regions \n \nTo elaborate, the scale up plan will entail: \n \n1. Review and Analysis of Gating Period Learnings \n \n\u2022 Gather comprehensive data from the pilot programs, including quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from stakeholders.  \n\u2022 Analyse the data to identify successful strategies that yielded significant impact, as well as challenges encountered during implementation. \n\u2022 Utilise insights gained to refine and adapt strategies for broader implementation at the district level.  \n \n2. Community Ownership: \n \n\u2022 Foster strong community engagement through participatory approaches that involve local residents in the decision -making process \n\u2022 Implement community-led initiatives that empower individuals and groups to take ownership of child protection efforts within their communities.  \n\u2022 Facilitate knowledge sharing and capacity building among community members to sustain positive changes beyond the duration of  the programme. \n \n3. District Level Implementation:  \n \n\u2022 Develop a detailed implementation plan in collaboration with partners, aligning it with the overarching goals of the child protection program.  \n\u2022 Establish clear communication channels and coordination mechanisms among all stakeholders involved in district -level implementation. \n\u2022 Provide ongoing support and guidance to district-level teams to ensure effective execution of the program objectives.  \n \n4. Engagement with Government:  \n \n\u2022 Develop a comprehensive engagement strategy for interacting with Govt. officials at various levels, emphasising the importanc e of their involvement in the program. \n\u2022 Organise regular meetings and workshops to facilitate dialogue and collaboration between program implementers and government stakeholders. \n\u2022 Provide technical assistance and policy recommendations to support Govt. efforts in strengthening child protection systems.  \n \n5. Capacity Building of Government Institutions: \n \n\u2022 Conduct thorough needs assessments to identify specific areas where Govt. institutions require capacity building support.  \n\u2022 Tailor training programs to address identified capacity gaps, ensuring that they are relevant, accessible and engaging for pa rticipants. \n\u2022 Work closely with Govt. stakeholders to develop SOPs that streamline processes and ensure consistency in service delivery acr oss different levels of the child protection system. \n \n6. Evidence Gathering for Scaling Up:  \n \n\u2022 Systematically document successful processes and interventions from the pilot programs, highlighting their effectiveness and scalability.  \n\u2022 Compile case studies and success stories to showcase tangible impact of the program on child protection outcomes.  \n\u2022 Utilise monitoring and evaluation data to identify key lessons learned and areas for improvement, informing the design of fut ure scaling up efforts. \n \n7. Scaling in Targeted Districts: \n \n\u2022 Develop a phased approach for scaling the program in targeted districts, prioritising areas with the greatest need and potent ial for impact. \n\u2022 Establish clear milestones and performance indicators to track progress throughout the scaling process.  \n\u2022 Continuously monitor implementation of the district and state levels, adjusting as necessary to address emerging challenges a nd capitalise opportunities for expansion. \n \n8. Understand cost and budget implications:  \n \nAs we progress, we will develop cost models outlining the resources required for government entities or other philanthropic o rganisations/NGOs to adopt and scale up our initiatives. \nThis approach ensures that our efforts remain cost-effective and feasible for integration into existing systems, fostering smoother adoption of our program model within the bro ader \nframework. \n \nMEL Approach \nThe implementing partners will conduct a vulnerability mapping exercise in each of the target villages. This will help to map  and identify all children in the villages; identifying at risk families \nand children and their participation in school education. This will also help us understand the current situation and getting a baseline, and setting clear targets for all implementing partners.  \n \nThe implementing partners will have dedicated Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Coordinators who will work in the project. They will report on pre- approved formats to the BAT MEL \npersonnel housed in the project management unit (PMU, BAT) of the state. The reporting to the project monitoring unit by the implementing partners will be quarterly. Monthly reports will \nbe asked by the PMU for better oversight purposes. For cases of survivors/ children in need of child protection (CNCP), the i mplementing partners will maintain data of plan of action and the \ncurrent status along with data on each referral/reporting and outcome of the action. Summary of these will be submitted to th e PMU on a monthly basis. The PMU at the state level, along \nwith technical partner in some cases, will undertake field visits, quality checks, audits, or other exercises to ensure data quality of the reported  data.  \n   \nBAT will onboard a specialised MEL partner to create standard protocols (SOP) and guidelines for all partners in the Monitoring system for COF/ Kawach programme. It will help in developing \nrobust systems for data collection, tracking, and necessary course corrections, performing quality checks and recommend a detailed quality assurance plan going forward in the programme \ncycle, to ensure the work is standardised and uniformly applied across the partners. An MIS will be developed that will track each child who has been reported or identified as victim/survivor \nor potential victim of child marriage/ child labour/ child trafficking and child sexual abuse and track this child throughout the process of reintegration, the MIS will also automate the reporting \nand visualisation of the state programme and will have automated reports for block, partner, and state level.   \n \nPhasing out strategy and sustainability plan \nThe one-year plan outlined here serves as the foundational framework for a comprehensive initiative that will span the next decade ba sed on the successes and learnings acquired. This \ninitiative is built on a systems -change approach, which means it focuses on creating lasting and sustainable change within the government\u2019s system while simultaneously empowering \ncommunities, including survivors with particular challenges or issues. The overarching goal is to foster accountability among  those responsible for fulfilling their duties.  \n \nOver the course of the next seven years, this proposed programme will strategically work towards fostering sustainable change s through social and economic transformations within the \ntargeted communities and working with the government to build capacity in the child protection workforce as well as other allied departments. This will include better implementation of \nthe existing policies such as Mission Vatslaya at various administrative levels, ranging from villages to blocks, districts, and state. Key stake holders in this process will include district \nadministrations, District Child Protection Units (DCPUs), local child protection committees, SMCs and the school education de partment.  \nA central element of this initiative is to motivate the gram panchayats (local self -governance bodies in rural India) to give greater priority and earmark budgetary resources specifically on \nchild protection endeavours. Securing budgetary allocations under the Gram Panchayat Development Plan will ensure that communities and child protection co mmittees can independently \nplan and implement child protection initiatives. It will also empower them to take ownership of their development initiatives and reduce dep endency on external agencies.  \n \nSustainability: The progress characterises the ability of the community to own and take actions towards prevention from exploitation and vuln erability. British Asian Trust along with Praxis \nhas developed certain tools like community maturity tool to empower the community groups by developing systems and process of collective learning within them.  \n \nThe impact of this programme will thus extend beyond its 10-year duration in creating stronger communities and accountable government systems. \n \nRole of the implementing partners (NGOs) \n \nThe implementing partners will play a pivotal role in translating the project objectives into tangible actions and outcomes. Our implementing partners are: \n\u2022 Child Rights and You (CRY) \n\u2022 Suprava Panchashila Mahila Udyog Samity (SPMUS) \n\u2022 City Level Programme of Action for Street and Working Children (CLPOA) \n\u2022 Bal Surksha Abhiyan (BSA) \n \nThe implementing partners will also co-create and execute tailored interventions such as facilitating collectivisation and building capacities of various stakeholders, conducting awareness \ncampaigns, liaising with authorities from the village to the district level and provision of support services. \n \nImplementing partners will therefore facilitate community engagement, and forge trust, collaboration and convergence with duty bearers which is critical in tackling child rights \nviolations and bringing about systems change. \n \nRole of Technical Partners \nThe current implementing  partners in  West Bengal possess commendable community mobili sation and government engagement skills, forming the core of our program. To bolster their \nefforts, BAT aims to enlist technical partners who will augment interventions related to livelihood and education.   \n \nEducation:  \nThe objective is to enhance program delivery by leveraging the expertise of established models, ensuring effective outcomes  with cost efficiency. We are considering organisations such as \nEducate Girls, Pratham, and the American India Foundation (AIF). \n\u2022 To conduct a comprehensive needs/gap assessment, focusing on: \n\u2022 Re-enrolment of children in age-appropriate classes and bring them back to schools. \n\u2022 Management of \"Remedial Coaching Centres\" with support to community volunteers or PNGO's outreach workers. \n\u2022 Strategies to prevent school dropouts by improving scholastic performances and the teaching-learning process. \n\u2022 Enhancement of school safety and engagement with School Management Committees (SMCs). \n\u2022 Activation and sustainable functionality of SMCs through effective interventions. \n\u2022 Development and implementation of a capacity building plan for implementing partners. \n\u2022 Streamlining and standardising processes for education as a preventive measure for child protection. \n\u2022 Serving as a knowledge partner for education in the program. \n \nSocial Protection Schemes and Livelihoods:  \nPotential partners may include AIF, Pradhan, Access, Jan Sahas, Haqdarshaq or Ajeevika. \nThe livelihoods technical partner will conduct a scoping study/systematic review the efficacy of the livelihood practices/ trades that can improve economic conditions of families of the children \nat risk; will help to align with the program's context and Theory of Change (ToC). This includes: \n \n\u2022 A comprehensive livelihoods assessment in program areas, with a focused intervention for increased livelihood opportunities and incomes. \n\u2022 Identification of alternative livelihoods, establishment of profitable livestock management practices, and building an ecosys tem for livestock. \n\u2022 Support in the rollout of appropriate technology in all interventions. \n\u2022 Technical support for scaling up cost-effective (short and medium term) and sustainable (long term) approaches to ensure households benefit from social protection schemes. \n\u2022 Assessment of the local economy, preparation of small business plans, orientation, and training on entrepreneurship developme nt. possess commendable community mobili sation and \ngovernment engagement skills, forming the core of our program.  To bolster their efforts, BAT aims to enlist technical partners who will augment interventions related to livelihood and \neducation. \n \nIn West Bengal, we have also onboarded the technical partners: \n\u2022 Praajak \n\u2022 Ajeevika Bureau \n\u2022 Nirmana \n \nPrajaak has been extensively working to address gender inequalities by challenging traditional norms and notions of masculinity and patriarchy. Over the years, Praajak has worked with a \nrange of child protection issues that include child trafficking, preventing and addressing unsafe migration, child sexual abuse, child, early and forced marriages, child work and labour. Prajaak \nworks collectively with children and youth, the communities they live in, the Government and other organisations to create a caring  and protective environment for all children. They use a \nrights-based approach to support vulnerable children and youth to use thei r individual potential and agency. Prajaak will be working closely with the field teams, children\u2019s collectives and \ncommunities to build their capacities in creating a gender equitable society. \n \nAjeevika Bureau has rich experience in providing solutions, services, and security to a large population of India\u2019s rural migrant workers. They combine direct service delivery, policy engagement, \nresearch, and technical support to advance the cause of migrant workers. Ajeevika Bureau has worked to provide lasting solutions to economic and socio-legal problems of migrant workers -  \ndirectly as well as through partners - by creating replicable models offering services and security both at source and destination. In West Bengal, Ajeevika will be  conducting research on the \nmigration trends from the tea gardens, focusing on the push and pull factors for migration and how the project can ensure safe migration.  \n \nNirmana initially provided logistic support to the National Campaign of Construction Workers, ensured participation of Constr uction Workers in the National Campaign by developing ties \nwith them through awareness generation and providing childcare, educatio n, health care services, legal aid etc. across the slums of North -West District. Subsequently NIRMALA NIKETAN, a \nDomestic Workers collective was promoted to assist the tribal women and young girls who migrate or are trafficked for domesti c work to Delhi an d other urban centres. Now, NIRMANA \naddresses a gap in policy for social security and livelihoods space amongst unorganised sector workers to achieve its overall  vision of 'Building an Inclusive India\u2019. Nirmana\u2019 s expertise lies in \nempowering unorganised sector workers so that they are able to achieve social security and dignified livelihood. Nirmana under this programme is a resource organisation who will be working \nto connect migrant workers with social security schemes and entitlements especially under the building and construction workers act and Domestic workers act. They will also work closely  \nwith tea garden workers association to strengthen their social protections under the plantation act.  \n \nThese partners with their deep understanding of the local context will also help to identify vulnerable children and address the specific risks that these children and their families face. \nProgramme \nObjectives \nC2I KPIs COF/Kawach \ntarget \nState \nBaseline \nState Targets Drivers of success and \nassumptions \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nImplement \nholistic \npreventative \napproaches that \nbuild family and \ncommunity \nresilience and \nstrengthen \nsystems for child \nprotection  \nStrengthen Village \nLevel  \nChild \nProtection \nCommittee \n(VLCPC)  \n% of villages with Child Protection Committee (CPCs) are  \na.

It had the 3rd highest number of reported crimes against child ren (NCRB 2011). The state tops the tables when it \ncomes to child rape and sexual abuse cases (NCRB 2011). Uttar Pradesh also had the highest reported child labour incidence (Census 2011). UP is among the top three states with \nthe maximum number of children trafficked between 2016 and 2022. 1 It is among the 10 poorest performing states in heath & nutrition, Human Development Index and \nMultidimensional Poverty Index. \nOver the past few years, our programmes in Uttar Pradesh (UP) have supported adults and children working in brick kilns and bonded labour settings. Our partners have achieved \nsignificant success in working with the rescued children, the survivors along with their families which culminated in the establishment of a social capital comprising 30,000 survivors \nand community members across the state. \nAdditionally, our partners have made notable strides in collaboration with the government by setting up a bonded labour track ing system in UP. They have also played a pivotal \nrole in fostering a network for policy engagement in the region. \n \n1 Child Trafficking in India: Insights from Situational Data Analysis and the Need for Tech-driven Intervention Strategies', by Games24x7 and the Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation (KSCF)   \nBuilding upon the knowledge and social capital gained from these initiatives, the proposed project now intends to implement a s a holistic prevention model across three districts \nand two blocks in each district of UP. This holistic model aims to address the multifaceted dimensions and needs of the communities by ensuring a comprehensive support system \nand integration with the government\u2019s social care and development initiatives.  \nThe following achievements of our programme (data captured from September 2022 to February 2023) have guided our strategy for  the road ahead:   \n\u2022 Activated 2500 child protection committees (CPCs) \n\u2022 Activated 75 school management committees (SMCs) in which a total of 5,670 dropouts were reconnected to school by regularising the DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) of children \nby holding monthly meetings. \n\u2022 Connected children of 7,680 survivors' families to school.  \n\u2022 Supported 230 families with livelihood support. \n\u2022 Integrated child protection into Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP). Ongoing interactions with panchayat representatives focus on strengthening panchayat-level child \nprotection committees (PLCPCs) and raising awareness about children's issues within t he community. \n\u2022 35 community vigilance committees have become activated to the level where they are sustainable and self -reliant  \n\u2022 Budget of more than INR 12 lakh has been blocked for inserting child friendly indicators in Gram Panchayat Development Plan i n 249 GPs. \n\u2022 65,560 Ayushman cards (Health Insurance) were made in collaboration with the government, in which 5,340 people were provided service in the hospital through the card. \n\u2022 76 villages allocated budgetary resources to fight child labour. Though the amounts allocated were small, this was an importa nt first step towards ensuring that village \nleadership takes responsibility for the prevention of child labour.  \n\u2022 Similarly, the government\u2019s Ayushman Bharat scheme has immense potential to prevent debt bondage.  In Uttar Pradesh, a 2020 o rder by health department obtained by \nBritish Asian Trust grantee Rural Organisation for Social Advancement (ROSA), was extended by  the State government and, as a result, health insurance cards were issued to \nmore than four million people throughout the state between January and March 2021.  A short study conducted by a civil societ y partner in 60 project villages illustrated how \nthis led to positive change for millions across the state. \nThese important pieces of learnings have influenced to upgrade our model and make it more comprehensive. The holistic model w ill address not only bonded labour issues but \nalso other critical child protection issues which are affecting the well-being of the children in UP and making them vulnerable. \nEarlier, we were working in seven districts in eastern UP.  However, based on the new strategic plan, we will continue to work in two of these districts (Prayagraj and Chandauli), \nexit from five districts and add one new district (Balarampur). \nProject executive summary   \nDuring the gating period, the project will consolidate learnings so far to pilot a holistic model which will implement three critical interventions in the same community: \n\u2022 Build economic resilience of vulnerable families through access to social security and livelihoods: By prioritising vulnerabl e families\u2019 access to social security schemes covering \nhealth, livelihoods, education, we can address their basic needs. This will be done with support from District Child Protection Units (DCPUs) and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). \nWe will also link vulnerable families to alternative livelihood opportunities for increased household income. Once the bare minimum is solved for, providing access to alternative \nlivelihoods will help families build positive aspirations, complement their incomes, and minimise the risk of them turning to detrimental practices like child labour, child marriage, \nand child trafficking   \n\u2022 Using schools as safety nets and safe spaces: Safe and thriving learning environments indirectly mitigate risks of children f alling into child labour, child marriage, and unsafe \nmigration. The project will undertake interventions to identify out of school children and ensure re-enrolment. All vulnerable children under the age of 14 will be supported to \ncontinue in school. \n\u2022 Strengthening community and governance institutions for structural, local, and timely response to child protection issues. This will include a systematic mapping and identification \nof all vulnerable children in the intervention districts, which will form the basis of tracking programme impact, success, and learnings.  \nThe project is built on evidence from our past work and stakeholder engagement at the local level. On one hand, this ensures that our programme is informed by real time \ninsights into the impact of our work, while on the other, we are able to closely collaborate with the government to integrate  best practices and scale up initiatives implemented \nby our partners in pilot villages. Through effective stakeholder engagement, we seek to institutionalise successful interventions and  amplify their impact. \nThis holistic strategy will be delivered on the ground by three partners namely MSEMVS, ROSA and Pragati Gramodyog Evam Samaj  Kalyan Sansthan (PGS). \nWe will also integrate and align Community Vigilance Committees (CVCs) and Azad Sakthi Group (Survivor federations), a unique  community-level protection mechanism by our \nUP partners, with CPCs as per mission Vatsalya. The CVCs consist of champions of child  protection, utilise non-violent community organising strategies to combat child trafficking \nand ensure accountability from authorities in upholding human rights. These CVCs have transformed their communities, reduced corruption, empowered women, enhanced \neducation, and expanded access to essential services. They have made significant strides in reducing child trafficking, and in well-established CVC areas, trafficking has been halted \naltogether. CVCs stand as a powerful force in the fight against child tra fficking and the promotion of child protection and create a lasting impact on the communities they serve. \nUntil now, CVCs have been focusing on labour trafficking and migration. Going forward, our partners will build their capaciti es to work on all child rights violations.  \nWe will also work with Technical partners such as Educate Girls or Pratham that have a track record of effective implementati on of sub-strategies relevant to KAWACH. They will \nprovide technical support to BAT\u2019s implementing partners on programme monitoring, evaluation, progress measurement and documentation of data. They will also help to ensure \nstandardisation of programme approaches and enhance programme equality amongst all the implementation partners.    \nBAT will collect all reports and relevant data from all the partners (implementing or technical), and be the link between tec hnical partners and implementation partners thereby \nalso acting as the repository for knowledge and tools being developed in the pr ogramme.   \nMain activities to be undertaken under the project \nVulnerability mapping and PRA  \n\u2022 Organise a Participatory Rapid Appraisal (PRA) exercise involving community members to identify hotspots of vulnerability.  \n\u2022 Engage community leaders, local organisations, and residents in discussions and activities to gain insights into key vulnerabilities and risks.  \n\u2022

a federation of survivors over the last few years with an approximate survivor base of 30,000 surviv ors across 7 districts, partners will continue to \nstrengthen this federation in existing districts.   \n\u2022 Bring together survivors who have been successfully reintegrated with the families and society to serve as champions of chang e in their communities. \n\u2022 Provide peer support to survivors who are still in the rehabilitation process and providing a platform for them to connect, support each other, and provide mentorship during \ntheir recovery and reintegration process. \n\u2022 Enhance the capabilities of survivors to effectively engage with government entities, empowering them to participate meaningf ully in relevant decision-making processes. \n \nScale-up plan  \nThe scale-up of best practices in UP will be executed by carefully identifying policy interventions, working collaboratively, and engaging with key identified government stakeholders \nfrom village to state level.  The approach we will take is reflected in one of our success stories - inclusion of child labour prevention in Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs)   \nIn August 2021, the Government of India's Ministry of Panchayati Raj initiated a people's campaign titled \u2018Sabki Yojna Sabka Vikas\u2019 and provided guidelines for activities to be \nundertaken by states from July 30, 2021, to January 31, 2022. The government of Uttar Pradesh, in response to this directive,  mandated the development of Gram Panchayat \nDevelopment Plans (GPDP) between October 2, 2021, and January 31, 2022.  \n1. MSEMVS's strategic intervention: \n\u2022 MSEMVS, recognising the opportunity for change, approached the District Panchayati Raj Officers in all 5 project districts.  \n\u2022 It submitted a fact sheet on child protection consisting of data and evidence. \n\u2022 It sought to include child labour prevention and child protection in GPDPs and allocate a budget at the village panchayat lev el. \n \n2. Multi-layered government engagement: \n\u2022 Our partner adopted a three-pronged approach: engagement with Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI), block authorities, and district authorities.  \n\u2022 It engaged village panchayats to include child labour prevention in their GPDP.  \n\u2022 It also enabled women's groups, children's groups, and vulnerable groups to amplify their voices, ensuring that the issues of  marginalised populations were included \nin the GPDP. \n\u2022  MSEMVS conducted meetings with District Panchayat Raj Officers (DPROs) to issue circulars that directed village and block panchayats  to include child labour \nprevention in GPDP. \n \n3. State-level engagement: \n\u2022 In a significant move, a delegation of UP partners met the Upper Chief Secretary of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj.  \n\u2022 They submitted a memorandum asking for child labour and child protection inclusion in GPDPs, along with a budget allocation o f \u20b9 10,000 for each Gram Panchayat \nin the state. \n\u2022 The Upper Chief Secretary accepted the memorandum, marking a substantial win for child protection.  \n \n4. Collaborative stakeholder engagement  \n\u2022 Simultaneously, the partners continued collaborative efforts with state Labour and Women and Child Welfare Departments. The collaborative approach was deemed \ncrucial for success. \n \n5. Block and district levels engagement: \n\u2022 The partner organisation actively engaged with block authorities responsible for the GPDP. Block authorities have the authori ty to allocate budgets for essential \nwelfare issues in GPDPs. \n\u2022 Child labour prevention was presented as an important issue, leading to strong engagement at both block and district levels.  \n \n6. Successfully creating provisions for child protection in the GPDPs: \n\u2022 The partner engaged with officials in 8 blocks across five districts, resulting in the inclusion of child labour prevention w ork and relevant budgets in their respective \nGPDPs. \n\u2022 Approximately 650 villages were involved, benefiting more than 16,250 families, and promoting grassroots anti-child labour initiatives with gram panchayat resources. \n   \nThis success story showcases the power of systematic engagement and collaboration in influencing positive change in child lab our prevention and protection at the grassroots \nlevel in Uttar Pradesh. Similar achievements were seen in Adoption of School manage ment committee modules within the government module and scale up of social security \nscheme linkages through Mega camps.  \nBritish Asian Trust and its NGO partners in UP will capture the learnings and focus on replicating the approaches in their re spective areas of intervention during the gating period \nand will further scale up efforts over the next 6-7 years. \n \nMEL Approach \n(Also refer MEL plan from IM annexes file) \n  \nThe implementing partners will conduct a vulnerability mapping exercise in each of the target villages, this will help map an d identify all children in the villages; identifying at risk \nfamilies and children and their participation in school education.  Th is will also help us in understanding the current situation and getting a baseline, and setting clear targets for \nall implementing partners.  \nThe implementing partners will have dedicated Monitoring Evaluation & Learning Coordinators who will work in the project. They will report on pre- approved formats to the BAT \nMEL personnel housed in the project management unit (PMU, BAT) of the state. The reporting to the project monitoring unit by the implementing partners will be quarterly. \nMonthly reports will be asked by the PMU for better oversight purposes. For cases of survivors/ children in need of child protection (CNCP), the implementing partners will maintain \ndata of plan of action and the current status along with data on each referral/reporting and outcome of the action. Summary o f these will be submitted to the PMU monthly. The \nPMU at the state level, along with technical partner in some cases, will undertake field visits, quality checks, audits or other exercises to ensure data quality of the reported data.  \n  \nBAT will onboard a specialised MEL partner to create standard protocols (SOP) and guidelines for all partners in the Monitoring system for COF/ Kawach programme. It will help in \ndeveloping robust systems for data collection, tracking, and necessary course corrections, performing quality checks and recommend a detailed quality assurance plan going \nforward in the programme cycle, to ensure the work is standardised and uniformly applied across the partners. An MIS will be developed that will track each child w ho has been \nreported or identified as victim/survivor or potential victim of child marriage/ child labour/ child trafficking and child se xual abuse and track this child throughout the process of \nreintegration, the MIS will also automate the reporting and visualisation of the state programme and will have automated reports for block, partner, and state level.  \n \nPhasing out strategy and sustainability plan   \nThe one-year plan outlined in the document would serve as the foundational framework for a comprehensive initiative that will extend over next 7 years. This initiative is built on \na systems-change approach and will focus on creating lasting and sustainable changes within the government system while simultaneously be empowering communities, including \nsurvivors who may be facing particular challenges. The overarching goal is to foster accountability among those responsible f or performing their duties. \n \nOver the course of the next five years, this proposed programme will strategically work towards influencing the quality imple mentation of existing policies at the best interest of \nthe children at every level of our administrative structure ranging from vil lages to blocks to districts and even the state level. Key stakeholders in this process will include school \nmanagement committees, the education department, labour department, ward and district administrations, Mission Vatsalya (District Child Protection Units - DCPUs), Panchayati \n& Rural Development Department, Home (Police) Department, and the broader education sector.  \n \nA central element of this initiative is to encourage gram panchayats to earmark budgetary resources specifically for child protection endeavours. This allocation of funds empowers \ncommunities to independently plan and implement activities, reducing their r eliance on external donors.  Some examples of local resource  \n\u2022 Schools:   \no Ensure separate toilets for boys and girls, provide facilities for practicing safer menstrual hygiene, and maintaining adequate classrooms with government-prescribed \nteacher-student ratios. These measures are crucial for preventing children from dropping out of school.  \n\u2022 Panchayats: \no Ensure the social and economic rehabilitation of survivors of trafficking and gender -based violence (GBV) and provide them psycho-social support as necessary. \no Enhance access to social protection schemes for vulnerable families, which in turn promote economic resilience within the com munities. \no Collaborate with Block administration to institutionalise the migration register, which will help track the migration of peop le from the targeted blocks under Kawach \nintervention. This data is vital for effective policy planning and ensuring the welfare of  migrant workers. \n \nBy fostering sustainable changes within the government system, engaging communities in the process, and encouraging local budgetary allocations, this initiative aims to create a \nlong-lasting legacy of improved child protection, education, and community emp owerment. The changes introduced during this period are intended to endure and positively \ninfluence the well-being of communities for many years to come. \n \nRole of the implementing partner(s) \nMSEMVS, PGS and ROSA will serve as the primary implementing organisations for holistic models in two districts - Chandauli (2 blocks, 121 villages) and Prayagraj (2 blocks, 88 \nvillages). These partners will operate at the grassroots level, extending support to vulnerable famil ies through various means, including livelihood programmes, education \ninitiatives, tracking mechanisms, awareness campaigns, and capacity -building efforts. They will also collaborate with local collectives and systems such as child pro tection \ncommittees (CPC), school management committees (SMC), self-help groups (SHGs), and more. In year one, partners will work in 10% of the villages in each block and scale up next \nyear to more villages. \nRole of technical partner \nThe current implementing partners in Uttar Pradesh (UP) possess commendable community mobilisation and government engagement skills, forming the core of our programme. \nTo bolster their efforts, BAT aims to enlist technical partners who will augment interve ntions related to livelihood and education. \n \nEducation:  The objective is to enhance programmes delivery by leveraging the expertise of established models, ensuring effective outcome s with cost efficiency. We are \nconsidering organisations such as Educate Girls, Pratham, and the American India Foundation (AIF).  \nTo conduct a comprehensive needs/gap assessment, focusing on: \n\u2022 Re-enrolment of children in age-appropriate classes and bring them back to schools. \n\u2022 Management of \"Remedial Coaching Centres\" with support to community volunteers or PNGO's outreach workers.  \n\u2022 Strategies to prevent school dropouts by improving scholastic performances and the teaching -learning process. \n\u2022 Enhancement of school safety and engagement with School Management Committees (SMCs).  \n\u2022 Activation and sustainable functionality of SMCs through effective interventions.  \n\u2022 Development and implementation of a capacity building plan for implementing partners.  \n\u2022 Streamlining and standardising processes for education as a preventive measure for child protection.  \n\u2022 Serving as a knowledge partner for education in the programme. \n \nSocial Protection Schemes and Livelihoods:  Potential partners may include: AIF, Pradhan, Access, Jan Sahas, Adarsha or Ajeevika.  \n   \n\u2022 The livelihoods technical partner will conduct a scoping study/systematic review the efficacy of the livelihood practices/ tr ades that can improve economic conditions of \nfamilies of the children at risk; will help to align with the programme's context and Theory of Change (ToC). This includes: \n\u2022 A comprehensive livelihoods assessment in programme areas, with a focused intervention for increased livelihood opportunities  and incomes. \n\u2022 Identification of alternative livelihoods, establishment of profitable livestock management practices, and building an ecosys tem for livestock. \n\u2022 Support in the rollout of appropriate technology in all interventions.  \n\u2022 Technical support for scaling up cost -effective (short and medium term) and sustainable (long term) approaches to ensure households benefit from social protection \nschemes. \n\u2022 Assessment of the local economy, preparation of small business plans, orientation, and training on entrepreneurship developme nt. \n \n \n \n    \nAnnexure: \nPROGRAM\nME \nOBJECTIVES \nC2I Indicator KPIs COF-\nKawach \nTARGET1  \nState \nBaseline \nState \nTargets \nDrivers of success / \nassumptions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nImplement \nholistic \npreventative \napproaches \nthat build \nfamily and \ncommunity \nresilience and \nstrengthen \nsystems for \nchild \nprotection \nStrengthen Village \nLevel \nChild \nProtection \nCommittee \n(VLCPC) \n% of villages with Child Protection Committee (CPCs) are \nOperational2 \nFunctional3 \n80% \n25% \nBaseline \nestimate \nafter \nvulnerabil\nity \nmapping \n60%  \n30% \n\u2022 Effective coordination \namong CBOs for harmonised \nprogramme \nimplementation, and clear \nalignment with KAWACH \nToC. \n\u2022 Correct and complete \nidentification of at-\nrisk and vulnerable \npopulations \n\u2022 Local communities and child \nprotection systems from \nvillage to state level are \nwilling to engage in dialogue \non child abuse and \nexploitation. \n\u2022 Effective mechanism to \ntrack every child in a village \nis in place. \n\u2022 NGOs exists in the project \ncatchment area to whom \nreported cases can be \nreferred. \n\u2022 Govt. mandate for \nChild protection \nthrough Mission \nVatsalya4 continues. \n \n% Increase in action \ntaken by child \nprotection bodies \n(e.g., CPCs, DCPU, \netc.) to prevent child \nlabour, sexual abuse, \nand trafficking \nNumber of reported cases to child protection bodies including Police, \nby the community for \nChild Labour (CL), \nChild Sexual Abuse (CA) \nChild Trafficking (CT) \nX% \nincrease in \nthe \nnumber of \nreported \ncases \nBaseline \nestimate \nafter \nobservati\non in field \nTargets \nto be set \nafter \nbaseline \nOf the total number of children; % of reported cases as \nChild Labour (CL), \nChild Sexual Abuse (CA) \nChild Trafficking (CT) \nTBD Baseline \nestimate \nafter \nobservati\non in field \nTargets \nto be set \nafter \nbaseline \n% of reported cases (CL, CA, CT) prevented at the VLCPC level TBD Baseline \nestimate \nafter \nobservati\non in field \nTargets \nto be set \nafter \nbaseline \n% of reported cases (CL, CA, CT) referred to police/higher authorities \n* (BAT will deploy system to track 'end-to-end\u2019 status of each reported \ncase, qualitatively capturing \n reasons for positive or negative outcome) \nTBD Baseline \nestimate \nafter \nobservati\non in field \nTargets \nto be set \nafter \nbaseline \n% of reported cases (CL, CA, CT) referred to NGO partners for case \nsupport \n* (BAT will deploy system to track 'end-to-end\u2019 status of each reported \ncase, qualitatively capturing \n reasons for positive or negative outcome) \nTBD Baseline \nestimate \nafter \nobservati\non in field \nTargets \nto be set \nafter \nbaseline \n# of Child Trafficking perpetrators identified by the VLCPC (with \nreference to CT) \nTBD Baseline \nestimate \nafter \nobservati\non in field \nTargets \nto be set \nafter \nbaseline   \n# of perpetrators reported by the VLCPC for action TBD Baseline \nestimate \nafter \nobservati\non in field \nTargets \nto be set \nafter \nbaseline \n% Increase in action \ntaken by child \nprotection bodies \n(e.g., CPCs, DCPU, \netc.) to prevent Child \nMarriage \n# of Child Marriage cases identified TBD Baseline \nestimate \nafter \nvulnerabil\nity \nmapping \nTargets \nto be set \nafter \nbaseline \nOf total number of children, % of reported cases of Child Marriage 10% -

The proposed programme has identified \nthe Departments of Women and Child Development, Education, Labour and Home/Police and the District Child Protection Units \n(DCPUs) as key agencies we need to work with. \nProject goal/aim Over the next 12 months, KAWACH will implement a holistic prevention model for reduction in prevalence of child marriage, child \nlabour, child trafficking, and exploitation. \nThe project will: \n\u2022 Build economic resilience of vulnerable families through access to social security and livelihoods  \n\u2022 Establish schools as safety nets and safe spaces for children \n\u2022 Strengthen community and government institutions \nAlignment with Kawach strategy \nand thematic areas \nThe project aligns with the KAWACH strategy with a focus on prevention. It will specifically:  \n\u2022 Build family and community resilience by addressing underlying drivers of vulnerability and re -integrating survivors.  \n\u2022 Strengthen systems from village to state by creating safe spaces, building capacities of key government duty bearers, and \nother stakeholders.  \n\u2022 Strengthen the child protection ecosystem through data and evidence, and by setting up multi -stakeholder platforms for \ncollaboration.   \nAlignment with Kawach \noutcome indicators  Refer to Annexure \nKey outputs, outcomes and \nimpacts expected  \nRefer to Annexure \nMEL approach  \n(Also refer to MEL plan from IM annexes file) \n    \nThe implementing partners will conduct a vulnerability mapping exercise in each of the target villages. This will help to map and \nidentify all children in the villages; identifying at risk families and children and their participation in school education.   This will also \nhelp us in understanding the current situation and getting a baseline and setting clear targets for all implementing partners.  \nThe implementing partners will have dedicated Monitoring Evaluation & Learning Coordinators who will work in the project. The y will \nreport on pre- approved formats to the BAT MEL personnel housed in the project management unit (PMU, BAT) of the state. The \nreporting to the project monitoring unit by the implementing partners will be quarterly. Monthly reports will be asked by the  PMU for \nbetter oversight purposes.

The PMU at the state level, along with technical partner in some cases, will \nundertake field visits, quality checks, audits or other exercises to ensure data quality of the reported data.  \n  \nBAT will onboard a specialised MEL partner to create standard protocols (SOP) and guidelines for all partners in the Monitori ng system \nfor COF/ Kawach. It will help in developing robust systems for data collection, tracking, and necessary course correction s, performing \nquality checks and recommend a detailed quality assurance plan going forward in the programme cycle, to ensure the work is \nstandardised and uniformly applied across the partners. An MIS will be developed that will track each child who has bee n reported or \nidentified as victim/survivor or potential victim of child marriage/ child labour/ child trafficking and child sexual abuse a nd track this \nchild throughout the process of reintegration. The MIS will also automate the reporting and visualisation of the state programme and \nwill have automated reports for block, partner, and state level. \n \nPhasing out strategy and \nsustainability plan   \nThe one-year plan outlined here serves as the foundational framework for a comprehensive initiative that  will give us the direction of \nurban centric child protection model and could be replicated in other urban locations like Delhi which is a key location for Kawach.   \nThis initiative is built on a systems-change approach, which means it focuses on creating lasting and sustainable changes within the \ngovernment system while simultaneously empowering communities, including survivors of particular challenges or issues. The \noverarching goal is to foster accountability among those responsible for fulfilling their duties.  \nStrategy for ensuring sustainability in this region involves bolstering household income through the establishment of liveliho od \nopportunities, such as women-led industries and the formation of self-help groups. The programme also places a strong emphasis on \neducation, where our partner concentrates on improving schools by strengthening school management committees (SMCs) and \nintegrating initiatives to safeguard children and enhance their educational experience  thus ensuring enrolment and retention of \nchildren in schools. \nWhy is this a good project for \nKawach  \n\u2022 Focuses on the most vulnerable children   \n\u2022 Aligned with our new strategy, theory of change and cascade to impact.   \n\u2022 Focused on community ownership of the prevention model as well as strengthening government systems  \n\u2022 Creating a proof of concept in urban setting    \nSummary of key risks and \npotential red flags- Risk \nmitigation plan/ strategy \nAttached in IM  \nContractual obligation of the \nrecipient organisation:  \nImplementation   \nReporting requirements Quarterly reporting  \nDetailed budget Attached in Annexure Below \n \nContext and problem statement \nRajasthan has the 6th highest number of reported crimes against children1 and the 9th highest number of child marriage incidents2 (NFHS -V). It also has the 3rd highest number of \nchild labourers according to Census 2011. Between 2018 and 2022, the state reported the highest incidence (23%) of child traf ficking as per MHA3 data. It remains among the 10 \npoorest performing states in relation to gender equality, and does poorly on Human Development Index 4 and Multidimensional Poverty Index5 (SDG \u2013 1,2, 3, 4, 5 & 10). \nDespite consolidated efforts by state, central governments, and NGOs, the prevalence of child labour persists in the state, i nfluenced by various factors.  \nWithin urban Jaipur we will focus on two slums. Selection of these slums was based on a baseline assessment conducted by Development Solutions, identifying vulnerable hotspots \nin Jaipur characterised by significant child rights violations, including child labour trafficking and a high number of out -of-school children. These pockets also exhibit a notable \npercentage of minority population. \nIn Jaipur, artisan and craft industries employ children in small -scale, unregulated family businesses. Seasonal migration from drought -prone rural areas to Jaipur exposes migrant \nchildren to the risk of forced labour due to poverty and limited access to ed ucation and social welfare. Identified hotspots are also susceptible to riots, impacting children's \neducation. Barriers to school enrolment have multiplied post -pandemic, compounded by cultural factors discouraging parents from sending their children to sc hool. Moreover, a \nsignificant portion of the population works in the informal sector, facing challenges in accessing social security benefits, often compelling children to engage in labour at an early \nage. \nJaipur's distinctive urban setting demands a comprehensive approach encompassing prevention, responsiveness, and rehabilitati on. The multipronged strategy includes \nestablishing child -labour resilient neighbourhoods through SEWA Shakti Kendra\u2019s (SSKs) and c ommunity empowerment. This involves empowering youth groups to discuss \nchildren's rights and cultivating grassroots women leaders (Agyewans) to enhance marginalised communities' access to social a nd health security, ensuring formal education for \ntheir children. \nAdditionally, the programme will focus on strengthening innovative livelihood models in identified hotspot areas to prevent l ocal children from entering labour. Efforts extend to \nfortifying schools within these hotspots to retain children and create safe s paces for their well -being. Psycho-social support, care, and guidance are provided, particularly for \nchildren rescued from labour and survivors of forced marriage or trafficking, facilitating their intellectual, emotional, and  social development. \nFurthermore, the youth in the communities will be empowered through education and vocational training, leading to increased a wareness and accountability towards children in \ntheir areas. The goal is the adoption of these interventions into systems through e vidence-based policy engagement and systemic capacity-building. \n \nOur previous work in Rajasthan has predominantly centred on the Child Labour Free Jaipur programme which focused on rescue and rehabilitation of child labourers by facilitating \nprosecution of the offenders and supporting the survivors. While that work has yielded significant results by providing livelihood and rehabilitation for survivors and conviction of \nthe offenders, we also saw that there was a high rate of re -trafficking of children if nothing was done to change the situation of children and their fam ilies at source. Hence, \nalthough we will continue to support rescued children in Jaipur to ensure they get re -integrated, our focus has now shifted to prevention.  \n \n1 NCRB 2021- https://ncrb.gov.in/uploads/nationalcrimerecordsbureau/custom/1696831798CII2021Volume1.pdf \n2 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1947773 \n3 https://www.mha.gov.in/MHA1/Par2017/pdfs/par2022-pdfs/LS-05042022/5311.pdf \n4 https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/IND \n5 https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2023-07/2023mpireportenpdf.pdf   \nOver the last year some key achievements have been: \n\u2022 1085 children rescued in Jaipur, with 107 rescued in transit from Bihar and 978 from workplaces in Jaipur.    \n\u2022 Trauma-informed counselling provided to 928 children at 8 police stations in Jaipur.  \n\u2022 Inter-state coordination established for restoring children from Jaipur to Bihar.  \n\u2022 803 police personnel trained and legal assistance provided to 230 child labour cases.  \n\u2022 261 children testified, with 89 bail pleas contested and 51 refused to grant bail.  \n\u2022 Quality institutional care ensured for 596 rescued children in Jaipur.  \n\u2022 808 rescued survivors from Jaipur reintegrated with their families in Bihar, with digitised legal documentation.  \n\u2022 141 self-help groups (SHGs) have been formed by partners working on livelihoods and two producer companies engaging 610 women in inter mittent work on textile \nstitching embroidery and lacquer products.   \nProject Summary: \nBuilding on our achievements in Jaipur and guided by our new strategy, we plan to enhance our prevention efforts in the urban  slums of Jaipur. While all our projects in other \nstates are village-focused, Jaipur will remain an urban-centric intervention, enabling us to pilot our prevention-led model in urban areas. We will work with partners like Pardarshita, \nSEWA Bharat, Access, LEDS, Centre for Child Protection (CCP), TAABAR in Jaipur to achieve outcomes. \nMain activities to be undertaken under the project \nThe project adopts a comprehensive approach to child protection and welfare, addressing multiple crucial areas. In its initial phase, the work in Rajasthan will focus on the following \ninterconnected streams: \n \nStrengthen Economic Resilience of Families: Taking advantage of Jaipur\u2019s textile and craft industry ACEES and SEWA will work towards providing sustainable livelihoods.  \n1) Develop institutions by strengthening women's entrepreneurship within the Producer Company, ensuring sustainable business pra ctices: \n\u2022 Provide skill development opportunities. \n\u2022 Enhance the child labour-free production process. \n\u2022 Establish sustainable market linkages. \n\u2022 Enable women artisans to leverage government schemes and facilitate Self -Help Group (SHG) women in accessing credit from formal financial sources.  \n\u2022 Empower women with skills to make products more marketable, connect to schemes enhancing income, and earn better wages through the Producer Company, thereby \nproviding sustainable livelihoods. This, in turn, keeps children away from work and encourages scho ol enrolment, elevating women's respect in households and \ninvolvement in decision-making. \n2) Connect Families to social security schemes: \n\u2022 Train family members in skill-based trades for income generation. \n\u2022 Facilitate the formation of SHGs and explore alternative livelihood options. \n\u2022 Establish a Women Producer Company. \nReducing dropouts and creating safe spaces within schools:   \n\u2022  Conduct school social audits.   \n\u2022 Identify and enrol out-of-school children. \n\u2022 Organise regular remedial coaching classes through bridge education centres.  \n\u2022 Collaborate with school administration, parents, and school management committees to ensure safe and conducive learning envir onments. \n\u2022 Track child retention rates in schools. \nImplement collectivisation strategies: \n\u2022 Create children's collectives and conduct life skills sessions. \n\u2022 Organise community meetings and forums with stakeholders. \n\u2022 Hold regular community meetings to discuss child protection issues.  \n\u2022 Establish forums for open dialogue, allowing community members to share concerns and ideas.  \n\u2022 Capacity building on Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) for parents, youth, and other community -level stakeholders. \n\u2022 Form core groups of children, parents, and community stakeholders to act as influencers within their communities.  \nPost-Rescue Care: \n\u2022 House rescued and at-risk children. \n\u2022 Improve nutrition to support age-appropriate physical and emotional development. \n\u2022 Engage children in personality-building and skill-building activities like sports, music, and dance. \n\u2022 Provide basic linguistic and numeric education. \n\u2022 Offer earning opportunities. \n\u2022 Provide mental health counselling and support for reintegration. \n\u2022 Provide end to end case management  \n\u2022 Connect with our partners in Bihar to track rehabilitation of the children (In areas where our partners are available)  \nEnhancing Capabilities of Key Stakeholders: \n\u2022 Collaborate with government and local institutions to strengthen governance, encourage service delivery accountability, and i mplement an evidence-based approach. \n\u2022 Engage with various entities such as Child Welfare Committees, CPC, District Administration, Law Enforcement Agencies, Labour Department, Department of Child Rights, \nWomen & Child Development, Social Justice and Empowerment Department, Education Department , and Health Department. \n\u2022 Promote transparency and child protection standards. \n\u2022 Establish documentation mechanisms and model approaches for dealing with children in child -friendly environments in communities, schools, and Childcare Institutes.  \n\u2022 Build new networks with interstate universities and departments focusing on child protection matters.  \n \nMoving from neighbourhoods to the state  \nIn Rajasthan, our lead partner, the Centre for Child Protection (CCP) at Sardar Patel Police University, will play a crucial role in expanding our interventions to a systemic level. The \nCCP has been instrumental in arranging meetings with various stakehold ers like: Education, Police, Legal Service Authority, Panchayati Raj etc. They have also helped promote \ncooperation and collaboration between these departments. Additionally, they will create a platform for providing training to various stakeholders. Over the next year, CCP will \ncontinue its support to expand best practices (like SMC trainings) and interventions carried out by Pardarshita and SEWA in t he fields of education and women and child welfare \nfurther enhancing our endeavours in child protection at the systemic level. \nTo achieve these outcomes, we will take on a holistic community -based and prevention-led model. Some guiding principles of our model are:   \n\u2022 Address stakeholder capacity gaps using community driven strategy:  The CCP programme in Jaipur identified significant skill deficiencies among various stakeholders including \ngrassroot functionaries within healthcare, education, law enforcement agencies, which resulted in mishandled cases and reduced prosecution rates. We will strengthen the system \nby analysing the practices followed in court and by police and developing SOPs for them to follow for better implementation o f legal processes. During this gating  period while \ncontinuing to work on child labour, CCP will initiate work on strengthening initiatives on child marriage by conducting needs  assessment with the police and designing a tool to \nsupport them in implementation of the law. CCP will also work with Pardarshita and SEWA for implementation of child protection committees and school management committees. \nCCP will pilot initiatives of CPC and SMC with Pardarshita and SEWA which will be used to design modules. These modules will then be implemented at d istrict level with the \nsupport of education and municipality department.  \n\u2022 Promote evidence-based stakeholder engagement: The programme underscores the importance of engagement with systems for policy change based on robust evidence, aiming \nto enhance the implementation of child protection initiatives. Our partners conducted comprehensive studies to gather data on  crucial child protection aspects. This has helped \nus offer well-informed recommendations and insights to enhance programme implementation for example a handbook on documentation of cases fo r police on child trafficking, \nschool social audits report etc. These data -informed approaches led to productive engagements with relevant government departments which resulted in a lot of changes in the \nschools and FIRs documentation. \n\u2022 Effective data management:  Partners worked with the CWC and supported them in digitisation of data by creating soft copies of documents of rescued child ren and creating a \ndatabase of children in need of care and protection. \n\u2022 Enhance collaboration and coordination:  The programme showcased the necessity of cooperation among various government departments and stakeholders to streamline \ndelivery of government services and ensure that social security benefits reach the most deserving families.  \nRole of the implementing Partner/s (NGOs) \n1. Pardarshita is a non -profit organisation founded by group of like -minded people working on pro -poor governance. It was registered in 29th December 2005 under Societies \nRegistration Act 1860 and also registered under FCRA with Ministry of Home Affairs, GOI.  The organisation began its journey with the aim of ensuring accountability in the public \ngovernance system by empowering the marginalised sections of society specifically focusing on women and children so that they can avail basic human rights and quality education \nto live with peace and dignity. Pardarshita is working with urban poor and marginalised in Delhi as well as in rural areas of  Jaipur and Uttar Pradesh. With BAT, Pardarshita has \nbeen working extensively on enrolling out-of-school children back into schools. It also runs bridge education centers in strategic neighborhoods where the number of out-of-school \nchildren is very high, such as Shastri Nagar and Ramganj. They have had a critical role in improving infrastructure of school s and transforming them into child safe spaces. They \nalso work with parents and families through SMCs and CPCs in these neighborhoods.  Pardarshita has core expertise in educatio n and will support other partners in conducting \nschool safety audits and SMC trainings in the district, \n2. SEWA Bharath \u2013Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA), meaning \"service\" in several Indian languages, is a trade union based in Ahmedabad, Indi a, that promotes the rights \nof low-income, independently employed female workers. Nearly 2 million workers are m embers of SEWA across eight states in India. With BAT, SEWA supports us in providing an \nessential intervention in our prevention -led work is improving the economic resilience of families to ensure that children are not forced to become the breadwinners o f their \nhouseholds. SEWA works with women to strengthen financial circumstances of families. It runs awareness campaigns, helps women  organise themselves into SHGs and holds \ncapacity building training for these women so that they can be linked to various liv elihood and social security schemes. SEWA uses these SHGs as key messengers on child rights \nprotection information the community. The SHG women are trained using a module on child labour. We are looking at expanding t he scope of this work to other child ri ghts \nviolations, thus spreading awareness among approximately 1200 women.    \n3. Access \u2013ACCESS is a national livelihoods support organisation, with focus on incubating innovations for sustainable livelihoods of th e poor. With support from DFID (Govt. of UK), \nACCESS was established in March 2006 as a professional new generation agency to contribute to and support poverty reduction in India.  By accelerating collaborative action with \nglobal, regional, and local stakeholders, ACCESS is driving financial resilience and security as key outcomes. ACCESS has bui lt strong competencies over the years by building a \ncommunity of practice around inclusive finance, generating evidence, convening regional and global programmes, supporting thought leadership and building a professional team. \nTo achieve outcome-based impact, ACCESS pursues a 3-tier approach: \n \n\u2022 Tier I \u2013 Improve value chains through innovation and digitisation  \n\u2022 Tier II \u2013 Empower stakeholders through capacity building and evidence generation  \n\u2022 Tier III \u2013 Support narratives through consultations and publications  \nWith BAT, Access will work with women from marginalised communities and provide skill training in stitching, embroidery and b angle making. It links these skilled women to \nproducer companies where they can earn wages for their work. They have played a cruci al role in ensuring industries such as bangle making and embroidery in Jaipur, which are \nthe biggest enablers of child labour, are moving towards being completely child labour free. Access over the last three years  has created a women producer company whic h \nprovides employment to 200 people with a turnover of approximately 50 lakhs The support this year is focused on seting up pra ctices so that women can manage the unit by \nthemselves from the profit that they are making.  \n4. Centre for Child Protection (CCP) \u2013 In the year 2015, SPUP established Centre for Child Protection with the vision that child, everywhere, must be accepted as a subject of right \nrather than as capital and / or as an asset.The centre, within the span of four years has developed its image internationally because of the following activities:  \no  To assess the systems and sub-systems of protection of children from formal and informal threats as well as visible and invisible threats  \no  To interpret various legal provisions associated with child\u2019s protection  \no  To make academic efforts for formation of democratic and just Indian society in which child could act freely and fearlessly w ith creativity. \nTo achieve the above objectives, CCP, through meaningful partnerships with various child rights actors, organizes research activities, capacity -building programmes, academic \nprogrammes, and takes actionable roles. CCP also strives to develop trained and skilled human resources so that efforts for protecting  children could move towards the desired \ndirection. CCP is considered a 'center for eminence,' enabling communication and the spread of values such as tolerance, peace, and non-violence, without which child protection \ncannot become a reality. With BAT, CCP works on capacity building with various stakeholders such as CPCs, SMCs, police, law enforcement agencies, district officials like the DCPU, \nand public prosecutors. They also conduct in-depth child safety awareness campaigns to empower and capacitate institutions directly dealing with children. Additionally, they have \nundertaken intensive work on post -rescue counselling for child labour and methodologies to support the mental well -being of vulnerable children. Moving forward,  CCP will play \na crucial role in institutionalizing practices established by our on-ground partner organizations. They will conduct a study on child marriage and leverage their position in the system \nto ensure convergence meetings. \nTAABAR \u2013 TAABAR runs shelter homes in Jaipur for rescued and at-risk children. At these homes, it focuses on the overall health and wellbeing of children \u2013 from nutrition to socio-\nemotional development to mental health. It also works towards rehabilitating  rescued children back into their native communities. \nRole of technical partner   \nIn the context of a technical partnership for a programme in Rajasthan, our approach involves collaboration with various part ners, each contributing unique skills and expertise. \nFor instance, Pardarshita specialises in education and school development, par ticularly in the urban settings of Jaipur slums, with a focus on strengthening schools and providing \nremedial education. Additionally, SEWA and Access play pivotal roles in enhancing the livelihoods of vulnerable community mem bers in Jaipur. While SEWA con centrates on \nstrengthening Self-Help Groups (SHGs), Access works towards developing child labour-free products through women producer companies. The Center for Child Protection, affiliated \nwith Sardar Patel Police University, serves as a key entity with th e primary objective of reinforcing systems based on insights gained from the experiences of these three \norganisations. \nThe current implementing partners in Rajasthan possess commendable community mobilisation and government engagement skills, forming the core of our programme. To bolster \ntheir efforts, BAT aims to enlist technical partners who will augment interventions related to livelihood and education.  \n \nEducation:  The objective is to enhance programmes delivery by leveraging the expertise of established models, ensuring effective outcome s with cost efficiency. We are \nconsidering organisations such as Educate Girls, Pratham, and the American India Foundation (AIF).  \nTo conduct a comprehensive needs/gap assessment, focusing on: \n\u2022 Re-enrolment of children in age-appropriate classes and bring them back to schools. \n\u2022 Management of \"Remedial Coaching Centres\" with support to community volunteers or PNGO's outreach workers.  \n\u2022 Strategies to prevent school dropouts by improving scholastic performances and the teaching -learning process. \n\u2022 Enhancement of school safety and engagement with School Management Committees (SMCs).  \n\u2022 Activation and sustainable functionality of SMCs through effective interventions.  \n\u2022 Development and implementation of a capacity building plan for implementing partners.  \n\u2022 Streamlining and standardising processes for education as a preventive measure for child protection.  \n\u2022 Serving as a knowledge partner for education in the programme. \n \nSocial Protection Schemes and Livelihoods: Potential partners may include: AIF, Pradhan, Access, Jan Sahas, Adarsha or Ajeevika.  \n \n\u2022 The livelihoods technical partner will conduct a scoping study/systematic review the efficacy of the livelihood practices/ tr ades that can improve economic conditions of \nfamilies of the children at risk; will help to align with the programme's context and Theory of Change (ToC). This includes: \n\u2022 A comprehensive livelihoods assessment in programme areas, with a focused intervention for increased livelihood opportunities  and incomes. \n\u2022 Identification of alternative livelihoods, establishment of profitable livestock management practices, and building an ecosys tem for livestock. \n\u2022 Support in the rollout of appropriate technology in all interventions. \n\u2022 Technical support for scaling up cost -effective (short and medium term) and sustainable (long term) approaches to ensure households benefit from social protection \nschemes. \n\u2022 Assessment of the local economy, preparation of small business plans, orientation, and training on entrepreneurship developme nt. \n \nAnnexure 1: \nPROGRAM\nME \nOBJECTIVES \nC2I Indicator KPIs COF-\nKawach \nTARGET\n1  \nState Baseline State \nTargets \nDrivers of success / \nassumptions   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nImplement \nholistic \npreventative \napproaches \nthat build \nfamily and \ncommunity \nresilience \nand \nstrengthen \nsystems for \nchild \nprotection \nStrengthen Village \nLevel \nChild \nProtection \nCommittee \n(VLCPC) \n% of villages with Child Protection Committee (CPCs) are \nOperational2 \nFunctional3 \n80% \n25% \nBaseline \nestimate after \nvulnerability \nmapping \n70%  \n20% \nEffective coordination among \nCBOs for harmonised \nprogramme implementation, \nand clear alignment with \nKAWACH ToC. \nCorrect and complete \nidentification of at-risk \nand vulnerable \npopulations \nLocal communities and child \nprotection systems from village \nto state level are willing to \nengage in dialogue on child \nabuse and exploitation. \nEffective mechanism to track \nevery child in a village is in \nplace. \nNGOs exists in the project \ncatchment area to whom \nreported cases can be referred. \nGovt. mandate for Child \nprotection through \nMission Vatsalya4 \ncontinues. \n \n% Increase in action \ntaken by child \nprotection bodies \n(e.g., CPCs, DCPU, \netc.) to prevent child \nlabour, sexual abuse, \nand trafficking \nNumber of reported cases to child protection bodies including \nPolice, by the community for \nChild Labour (CL), \nChild Sexual Abuse (CA) \nChild Trafficking (CT) \nX% \nincrease \nin the \nnumber \nof \nreported \ncases \nBaseline \nestimate after \nobservation in \nfield \nTargets \nto be set \nafter \nbaseline \nOf the total number of children;

It has the 8th highest number of  reported crimes against children (NCRB 2021), and the 2nd highest incidents \nof child marriage (NFHS V) & child labour (Census 2011) in the country. The school dropout rate too is the 3rd highest (UDISE). According to a recent report2, Bihar is among the top three states with \nthe maximum number of children trafficked between 2016 and 2022. \nIn the post-COVID period, we have seen a disturbing rise in trafficking and migration from Bihar to Jaipur in Rajasthan for child labour. \nA 2022 evaluation of the Child Labour Free Jaipur project revealed alarming statistics. Child labour was found to be prevalent in 31% of units in Jaipur, a staggering 100% increase from 2018. Additionally, \n42% of these units employed adolescents, a 61% increase from 2018. To avoid detection and prosecution, these business units have adapted various methods, such as shifting operations of bangle \nproduction units that employ children to Bihar. Moreover, some of these businesses are functioning under the guise of family-owned units, where children can be made to work without scrutiny. This \nsituation underscores the pressing need for prevention efforts in Bihar to support families to overcome their vulnerabilities  that pressurise them to send their children to work. \n \nOver the last year, the programme spanned 24 districts and achieved the following: \n\u2022 Reduced re-trafficking of survivors to less than 1% . \n\u2022 Successfully garnered the attention and interest of the top government departments and administrators, specifically the Chief Secretary of the Government of Bihar, to address the challenges \nassociated with rehabilitation of rescued child labourers and to reduce the incidence of child labour in Bihar.  \n\u2022 Transformed child protection and  child labour from being solely the concern of Social Welfare or Labour Resource Departments into  a shared responsibility among various entities and \ndepartments including PRIs, Education Department, Home Department, Jeevika/ Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society (BRLP) and others through our persistent outreach. \n\u2022 Connected vulnerable families with the PM-JAY scheme (health insurance), surpassing our target by more than 100%, ensuring that families are protected from health-related hazards and do not \nfall into a debt trap. \n\u2022 Activated essential social protection mechanisms and extended their reach to 90 % of the most vulnerable households and communities. \n\u2022 Closely collaborated with the Bihar Child Labour Commission, enhancing the impact of our efforts. \n \nExecutive Summary \nOur current strategy will primarily focus on prevention approaches; and derives from the  critical learnings and achievements of the Child Labour Free Jaipur programme and our subsequent efforts \nin Bihar. Therefore, our holistic programme model addresses not only child labour but also other critical issues affecting the wellbeing of the vulnerable children and their families in Bihar. It aims \nto systematically identify, reach, and empower most vulnerable communities in Bihar to protect their children from various vi olations of child rights. Given the concerning indicators regarding \nchild protection in Bihar, our initiative seeks to address the root causes of these violations.  \nDuring the gating period, the project will consolidate learnings so far to pilot a holistic model which will implement three critical interventions in the same community: \n1. Build economic resilience of vulnerable families through access to social security and livelihoods: By prioritising vulnerable families\u2019 access to social security schemes covering health, livelihoods, \neducation, we can address their basic needs. This will be done with support from District Child Protection Units (DCPUs) and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). We will also link vulnerable families \nto alternative livelihoods options t o increase household income. Once the bare minimum is solved for, providing access to alternative livelihoods will help famil ies build positive aspirations, \ncomplement their incomes, and minimise the risk of them turning to detrimental practices like child  labour, child marriage, and child trafficking \n2. Using schools as safety nets and safe spaces: Safe and thriving learning environments indirectly mitigate risks of children falling into child labour, child marriage, and unsafe migration. The project \nwill undertake interventions to identify out of school children and ensure re-enrolment. All vulnerable children under the age of 14 will be supported to continue in school.  \n3. Strengthening community and governance institutions for structural, local, and timely response to child protection issues. This will include a systematic mapping and identification of all vulnerable \nchildren in the intervention districts, which will form the basis of tracking programme impact, success, and learnings.  \n \nThe project is built on evidence from our past work and stakeholder engagement at the local level.  On one hand, this ensures  that our programme is informed by real time insights into the \nimpact of our work, while on the other,  we are able to closely collaborate with the government to integrate best practices and scale up initiatives implemented by ou r partners in pilot villages. \nThrough effective stakeholder engagement, we seek to institutionalise successful interventions and am plify their impact.  \nIn addition, our programm e aims to integrate awareness campaigns and behaviour change initiatives aimed at addressing critical child protection challeng es. By raising awareness and shifting \nmindsets within communities, we will equip both adults and children with the knowledge and t ools to protect themselves and promote their well-being. \n \nImplementation partners \nThe initiatives on the ground with communities, Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and the block administration will be imple mented by credible organisations like Center Direct, Aditi, Bhusra Mahila \nVikas Samiti (BMVS), Tatvasi Samaj Nyas (TSN), and Samagra Sikchhan Evam Vikas Sansthan (SSEVS). These organisations are known for their strong relationships with government departments as \nwell as grassroot communities, and will collaborate with key stakeholders across various blocks, districts, and divisions wit hin the state. \nWe will also work with technical partners such as Educate Girls, Jan Sahas, or  Pratham, having a track record of effective implementation of sub -strategies relevant to the ToC for COF. They will \nprovide technical support to BAT\u2019s implementing partners on programme monitoring, evaluation, progress measurement and docume ntation of data. They will also help to ensure standardization of \nprogram approaches and enhance program quality amongst all the implementation partners.  \n \nThe British Asian Trust will analyse, consolidate, and manage the knowledge and best practices shared by all partners. As per the programme MIS, we will house all reports and relevant data, and build \na repository of knowledge for use across the board. This will help provide an evidence base for cross learning, collaboration, and scale. \n \nActivities to be undertaken under the project \nA) Vulnerability mapping and PRA  \n\u2022 Organise a Participatory Rapid Appraisal (PRA) exercise involving community members to identify hotspots of vulnerability.  \n\u2022 Engage community leaders, local organisations, and residents in discussions and activities to gain insights into key vulnerab ilities and risks. \n\u2022 Collaboratively identify areas within the community that are particularly vulnerable to various risks and hazards.  \n\u2022 Partner teams to conduct door-to-door mapping of households within identified hotspots, and collect data on households, including information on household com position, socio-economic status, \nand presence of at-risk children, education status etc \n\u2022 During the door-to-door mapping process, specifically identify and document households with at -risk children. \n\u2022 Compile the data collected during the mapping exercise to create a comprehensive base document.  \n\u2022 Prioritise these hotspots based on factors such as socio-economic status, access to resources, and susceptibility to threats. \n\u2022 Establish a system for tracking at-risk children based on the data collected during the mapping exercise.  \n\u2022 Implement strategies to monitor the well-being and development of these children over time, ensuring they receive appropriate support and interventions.  \n  \nB) Strengthening of institutions and community \n1.

Schools as safe spaces:  \n\u2022 Encourage teachers to serve as advocates for child protection within schools and their respective communities  \n\u2022 Empower teachers to actively promote child protection measures and policies to reduce dropouts and enhance student retention  \n\u2022 Facilitate discussions and initiatives among teachers to address child protection concerns and foster a supportive environmen t for students. \n  \n2. Re-Enrolment and Regularity Support \n\u2022 Work closely with School Management Committees (SMCs), school authorities, teachers, and parents to identify and re -enrol children who have dropped out of school, especially those children \nfrom 6- 14 years of age.  \n\u2022 Address socioeconomic barriers hindering children's regular attendance through targeted interventions and support  \n\u2022 Support children in availing DBT from schools for uniforms, books, and scholarships.  \n\u2022 Collaborate with schools to establish remedial education classes for students who require additional support  \n  \n3. Collaboration and Coordination \n\u2022 Foster collaboration and coordination among stakeholders including SMCs, school authorities, teachers, parents, and community  leaders \n\u2022 Conduct regular meetings and consultations to discuss enrolment strategies, address challenges, and monitor progress  \n\u2022 Establish mechanisms for ongoing communication and feedback to ensure effective implementation of enrolment and child protect ion initiatives within schools. \n  \nF) Survivor Federations: \nBihar has an existing survivor group of 1215 survivors across 20 districts, partners will work towards creating a federation of survivors by building their capacities.  \n\u2022 Bring together survivors who have been successfully reintegrated with the families and society to serve as champions of chang e in their communities. \n\u2022 Provide peer support to survivors who are still in the rehabilitation process and providing a platform for them to connect, s upport each other, and provide mentorship during their recovery and \nreintegration process. \n\u2022 Enhance the capabilities of survivors to effectively engage with government entities, empowering them to participate meaningf ully in relevant decision-making processes. \n \nScale-up plan  \nIn Bihar, we have strategically selected one district each from four divisions. The work in each district will be developed as a pilot intervention. Based on the learnings from these pilots, partners \nwill work to implement changes at the division level in collaboration with government  and stakeholders from the child protection system. This will help scale impact across the divisions.  \n \nThe programme structure is designed to make this a success. The BAT State lead along with a partner NGO will be responsible for engaging with the government\u2019s child protection system to build \nthe capacity of all relevant duty bearers at the division/ district and state  level. Additionally, the programme will take into account:  \n \n\u2022 Community ownership: Community based work ensures that the interventions are owned by the community, and the shift only deepens once the project has ended. We will work with family and \ncommunity members to realise positive shifts in knowledge, attitudes, and practice, and drive knowledge and behaviour change within communities. \n \n\u2022 Engagement with the government: \no Engaging with relevant officials (such as the Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development and Panchayat Raj department ) as well as District Magistrates right from inception of the \nprogramme to improve the quality of care provided by the Child Protection system. This will also help provide access to the most deserving families to social protection schemes implemented \nthrough the PRI System. \no Conducting state-level stakeholder mapping exercises with all partners, and building stakeholder and policy engagement plans to include identify the key policy gaps and actors  \no Where possible, we will formalise these arrangements through Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to ensure continuity of the collaborative action regardless of changes in bureaucratic \nor political incumbents. \n \nExample: PMJAY Implementation: In the previous years, partners made significant strides in the implementation of PMJAY (Pradhan  Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana) in Bihar. The impact of this \ninitiative was meticulously documented and submitted to the state health department. Activities like organising mega camps gained recognition and were subsequently scaled up across the \nstate. \n \n\u2022 Building Capacity of Government Institutions:  Along with active engagement with the government we will work to strengthen capacities of key government institutions on the knowledge, \nnorms, resource, and implementation gaps in the system to make the collaboration work. To strengthen the institutional capacity of the government system, our approach entails comprehensive \nengagement across multiple levels. This involves con ducting thorough needs assessments to identify capacity gaps and designing tailored training programs to address them. Additi onally, we \ncollaborate closely with government stakeholders to develop and implement Standardised Operating Procedures (SOPs), ensuring consistency and efficiency in processes. By integrating relevant \ntrainings, SOP development, and collaborative efforts into our approach, we aim to empower government institutions with the tools and resources necessary to address complex social challenges \neffectively and sustainably. \n\u2022 Gather evidence for scaling up: To scale to 25% of all villages in the selected blocks under targeted districts, and institutionalise best practices at district and state level, we will: \no Identify and demonstrate certain processes that can scale impact. e.g., creating standardised modules for formation and training of CPCs and enabling safe school standards. \no Capture and document key success factors for relevant government bodies to adopt them as seamlessly as possible. \no Conduct an end-line evaluation to consolidate learnings and evidence for replication and scale up. The findings will be shared with the government and will enable us to scale up the programme \nin each of the selected states. \nExample: Partners are collecting data related to child labour tracking systems in collaboration with Child Welfare Committees (CWC) at the district level. The collected data from the Child Labour \nTracking System (CLTS) at the district level is then used to analyse trends across the state concerning the release of victim compensation. This data is presented at state-level meetings with \npolicymakers, including the Chief Secretary, who reviews the consolidated information and conducts discussions with District Magistrates. This process has led to a directive to streamline victim \ncompensation through the Chief Minister's Relief Fund. \n \n\u2022 Understand cost and budget implications: Throughout our work, we will build out cost models of what it would take for the government system  or other philanthropies/ NGOs to adopt and \nexpand our initiatives. This will ensure we are not using efforts that are too costly and could be implemented by the system going forward. This will ensure smoother adoption of the programme \nmodel within the system.  \n \nMEL approach \n(Also refer to MEL plan from IM annexes file) \nThe implementing partners will conduct a vulnerability mapping exercise in each of the target villages, this will help  to map and identify all children in the villages; identifying at risk families and \nchildren and their participation in school education.  This will also help us in understanding the current situation and getting a baseline and setting clear targets for all implem enting partners. \nThe implementing partners will have dedicated Monitoring Evaluation & Learning Coordinators who will work in the project. They will report on pre- approved formats to the BAT MEL personnel \nhoused in the project management unit (PMU, BAT) of the state. The reporting to the project monitoring unit by the implementing partners will be quarterly. Monthly reports will be asked by \nthe PMU for better oversight purposes. For cases of survivors/ children in need of child protection (CNCP), the implementing partners will maintain data of plan of action and the current status \nalong with data on each referral/reporting and outcome of the action. Summary of these will be submitted to the PMU on a mont hly basis. The PMU at the state level, along with technical \npartner in some cases, will undertake field visits, quality checks, audits or other exercises to ensure data quality of the reported dat a. \n \nBAT will onboard a specialised MEL partner to create standard protocols (SOP) and guidelines for all partners in the Monitori ng system for COF/ Kawach  programme. It will help in developing \nrobust systems for data collection, tracking, and necessary course corrections, performing quality checks and recommend a detailed quality assurance plan going forward in the programme cycle, \nto ensure the work is standardised and uniformly applied across the  partners. An MIS will be developed that will track each child who has been reported or identified as victim/survivor or \npotential victim of child marriage/ child labour/ child trafficking and child sexual abuse and track this child through out the process of reintegration, the MIS will also automate the reporting and \nvisualisation of the state programme and will have automated reports for block, partner, and state level. \n \nPhasing out strategy and sustainability plan \nThe one-year plan outlined here serves as the foundational framework for a comprehensive initiative that will span the next decade based on the successes and learnings acquired. This initiative \nis built on a systems-change approach, which means it focuses on creating lasting and sustainable change within the government\u2019s system while simultaneously empowering communities , \nincluding survivors with particular challenges or issues. The overarching goal is to foster accountability among those respon sible for fulfilling their duties. \nOver the course of the next seven years, this proposed programme will strategically work towards fostering sustainable changes through social and economic transformations within the targeted \ncommunities and working with the government to build capacity in the child protection workforce as well as other allied departments. This will include better implementation of the existing \npolicies such as Mission Vatslaya at various administrative levels, ranging from villages to blocks, districts, and state. Key stakeholders in this process will include ward and district administrations, \nDistrict Child Protection Units (DCPUs), local child protection committees, SMCs and  the school education department. \nA central element of this initiative is to motivate the gram panchayats (local self -governance bodies in rural India) to give greater priority and earmark budgetary  resources specifically on child \nprotection endeavours. This allocation of funds empowers communities to independently plan and implement the activities, reduce their dependency on external donors. By emphasising local \nbudget allocation for child protection efforts, this initiative fosters community self -reliance, empowering them to take ownership of their development initiatives and reducing external \ndependency. \n \nSustainability: The progress characterises the ability of the community to own and take actions towards prevention from exploitation and vulnerability. British Asian Trust along with Praxis has \ndeveloped certain tools like community maturity tool to empower the community groups by developing systems and process of collective learning within them. The tool helps to asses s, plan \nand monitor their progress from low maturity to high maturity. \n \nRole of the implementing Partner/s (NGOs) \nBushra Mahila Vikas Samithy in Darbhanga, Aditi in Sitamarhi, Tatvasi Samaj Nyas in Katihar, and Center Direct in Gaya  have been selected as the main implementing organisations  in \nintervention districts. These districts have been strategically chosen across four divisional commissionerate. The partners will implement  the comprehensive model in 70 villages within these \ndistricts. The success of these pilot projects will then be demonstrated at th e divisional commissionerate level, and the partners will collaborate with local authorities to ensure the \nimplementation of proven models and best practices across all districts wi thin each division. \nThese four partners will operate at the grassroots level, providing support to vulnerable families through various initiative s, including livelihood programs, educational activities, monitoring  \nsystems, awareness campaigns, and capacity -building. Additionally, they will work in collaboration with local groups and structures such as Child Protection Committees (CPCs), School \nManagement Committees (SMCs), Self-Help Groups (SHGs), and others. \n \nRole of technical partner \n \nEducation: An education partner like Pratham/ Educate Girls will act as a credible knowledge partner, and help assess gaps in the programme regarding: \n\u2022 Re-enrolment of children to age-appropriate classes and back into school \n\u2022 Management of the remedial coaching centres and support to the community volunteers \n\u2022 Interventions and strategies to prevent dropouts from school by improving the scholastic performances of children, and the teaching- learning process inschools. \n\u2022 Strategies to improve school safety and engagement with SMCs \n\u2022 Effective interventions to activate and ensure sustainable functionality of SMCs \n\u2022 Develop and implement the \u201ccapacity building plan\u201d for the implementing partners in the areas mentioned above \n\u2022 Streamline and standardise processes for education as a preventative means for addressing child protection. \n \nLivelihood: \nWe will bring in a technical partner such as America India Foundation (AIF) or Pradan  to conduct a study on most viable trades of rural livelihoods, feasibility of  the trades and consequently \nprovide technical support to the implementing partners to experiment and implement livelihoods programme on the ground in selected blocks/ districts. The scoping study of livelihoods practices \naligned towards improving the economic conditions of families of the vulnerable children will be done by the Technical Agency. The work on livelihoods would help in doubling the incomes, asset \nbuilding or other standards of the economically weaker families to ensure the livelihood programmes as effective.  \n \nWe will also work with SSEVS who has demonstrated significant impact through its livelihoods work with marginalised communities.  They have assisted survivors and their families in acquiring \nessential skills, supported them in establishing small businesses, and notably established bike garages, vegetable markets, small vegetable farms, and livestock rearing initiatives  for survivors. \nBuilding on their successes, SSEVS will extend support to all implementing organisations across the state, working towards the goal of economic resilience through alternative livelihoods for \nfamilies. SSEVS will serve as a technical expert agency for livelihood-related matters. \n \nExpertise of SSEVS: SSEVS has successfully organised 2303 farmers into 143 farmers interest groups (FIGs). These farmers, equipped with a comprehensive package of practices, technical inputs, \nand market linkages, are now cultivating pulses, securing fair prices for their produce. SSEVS has also played a pivotal role in empowering 212 Dalit families, nearly doubling their income through \nvegetable cultivation, subsequently improving their nutritional intake. Notably, the org anisation's efforts extend beyond individual farmers to the establishment of two farmers producers\u2019 \ncompanies. SSEVS actively promotes kitchen gardens, benefiting 200 families/farmers and enhancing their nutritional well-being. Recognizing the gender dimension, SSEVS has introduced small \nagricultural tools, reducing the labour burden on 500 women farmers.  \nConservation practices, such as the adoption of the zero-tillage technique and river basin farming, contribute to resource efficiency and ecosystem \npreservation. Furthermore, 37 landless farmers have embraced sustainable practices by establishing vermi-compost pits, producing organic vermi compost for field use and sale. SSEVS's holistic \napproach addresses livelihoods, nutrition, gender inclusivity, and environmental sustainability in the agricultural sector. \n \nSystem Strengthening: Over the past year, due to Center Direct's engagement with the system, we have witnessed significant impact , such as meetings with the Chief Secretary to discuss victim \ncompensation schemes and other convergence actions for child labour. State Child Prote ction Societies (SCPs) have issued orders for the formation of Child Protection Committees (CPCs), not \njust for Center Direct but for all partners in the network  in Bihar. Additionally, mega social security camps have been conducted through DLSA. Suresh Kumar, the Executive Director of Center \nDirect, has  gained significant importance among all stakeholders. He has been invited to conduct capacity building on child rights issues for stakeholders such as police and legal entities. \nStakeholders also reach out to Center Direct for guidance in handling challenging cases . \n \nPROGRAMM\nE \nOBJECTIVES \nC2I Indicator KPIs COF-Kawach \nTARGET1  \nState Baseline State Targets Drivers of success / assumptions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nImplement \nholistic \npreventative \napproaches \nthat build \nfamily and \ncommunity \nresilience \nand \nstrengthen \nsystems for \nchild \nprotection \nStrengthen Village Level \nChild Protection \nCommittee (VLCPC) \n% of villages with Child Protection Committee (CPCs) are \na)Operational2 \nb) Functional3 \na) 80% \nb) 25% \nBaseline estimate \nafter vulnerability \nmapping \na) 80%  \nb) 25% \n\u2022 Effective coordination among \nCBOs for harmonised programme \nimplementation, and clear \nalignment with KAWACH ToC. \n\u2022 Correct and complete \nidentification of at-risk and \nvulnerable populations \n\u2022 Local communities and child \nprotection systems from village to \nstate level are willing to engage in \ndialogue on child abuse and \nexploitation. \n\u2022 Effective mechanism to track \nevery child in a village is in place. \n\u2022 NGOs exists in the project \ncatchment area to whom reported \ncases can be referred. \n\u2022 Govt. mandate for Child \nprotection through Mission \nVatsalya4 continues. \n \n% Increase in action \ntaken by child protection \nbodies (e.g., CPCs, DCPU, \netc.) to prevent child \nlabour, sexual abuse, \nand trafficking \nNumber of reported cases to child protection bodies \nincluding Police, by the community for \n- Child Labour (CL), \n- Child Sexual Abuse (CA) \n- Child Trafficking (CT) \nX% increase in the \nnumber of reported \ncases \nBaseline estimate \nafter observation \nin field \nTargets to be \nset after \nbaseline \nOf the total number of children; % of reported cases as \n- Child Labour (CL), \n- Child Sexual Abuse (CA) \n- Child Trafficking (CT) \nTBD Baseline estimate \nafter observation \nin field \nTargets to be \nset after \nbaseline \n% of reported cases (CL, CA, CT) prevented at the VLCPC level TBD Baseline estimate \nafter observation \nin field \nTargets to be \nset after \nbaseline \n \n% of reported cases (CL, CA, CT) referred to police/higher \nauthorities \n* (BAT will deploy system to track 'end-to-end\u2019 status of each \nreported case, qualitatively capturing reasons for positive or \nnegative outcome) \nTBD Baseline estimate \nafter observation \nin field \nTargets to be \nset after \nbaseline \n \n1 Targets will be recalibrated based on baseline and results of pilot at Gating. \n2 Operational is defined by: a).

Only  35  cases  were  registered  on  the  MIS  tool  despite  signi\ufb01cant  ground  activity.  \u25cf  MIS  tool  usage  is  inconsistent,  with  only  six  out  of  13+  animators  making  entries.  The  team  lacks  familiarity  with  the  tool,  views  it  as  an  additional  workload,  and  struggles  with  basic  functionalities  due  to  insuf\ufb01cient  practice  and  training.  \u25cf  There  is  no  routine  for  data  entry,  and  the  organisation  has  not  prioritised  integrating  the  MIS  tool  into  daily  operations.

Meeting  minutes  were  uploaded  for  a  few  sessions  but  could  not  be  veri\ufb01ed  due  to  the  absence  of  physical  records.  \u25cf  The  team  displayed  minimal  engagement  with  the  MIS  tool;  one  CM  was  unaware  of  the  system,  while  others  had  uninstalled  the  app.  A  comprehensive  orientation  was  conducted,  but  sustained  handholding  and  feedback  are  necessary  for  familiarity  and  con\ufb01dence.  \u25cf  The  organisation  lacks  proper  protocols  and  formats  for  documenting  activities,  with  \ufb01eld  work  largely  unsupervised.  The  team  is  spread  across  two  districts,  creating  further  operational  challenges.  \nUttar  Pradesh  ROSA  \u25cf  ROSA  had  164  submissions  in  the  MIS  tool,  but  only  two  CPC  and  no  SMC  monthly  meetings  were  recorded.  Many  submissions  lacked  meeting  minutes  or  attendance  registers,  and  errors  in  classifying  activities  caused  data  issues.  \u25cf  Community  mobilisers  found  the  tool  dif\ufb01cult  to  use,  struggling  with  features  like  auto-sync  and  categorising  activities.  A  training  session  helped  address  some  problems,  but  more  regular  training  and  dashboard-focused  sessions  are  needed.  \u25cf  Limited  support  from  senior  staff  and  the  extra  workload  of  internal  reporting  made  it  hard  for  the  team  to  use  the  MIS  tool  effectively.

While  the  data  was  consistent  with  physical  records,  entries  lacked  detailed  evidence,  such  as  meeting  minutes,  and  follow-ups  for  registered  cases  were  not  entered.  \u25cf  The  team  struggled  with  MIS  tool  features  and  proper  classi\ufb01cation  of  activities,  with  errors  such  as  miscategorising  SMC  meetings  and  social  protection  work.  A  training  session  helped  clarify  these  gaps,  but  more  practice  and  guidance  are  required,  particularly  for  new  features.  \u25cf  Organisational  challenges,  including  the  Programme  Coordinator's  limited  technical  pro\ufb01ciency  and  the  team\u2019s  heavy  workload,  have  hindered  the  effective  use  of  the  dashboard  and  MIS  tool.  \n2  2  2  \nCD  \u25cf  CD  submitted  299  entries  in  October,  mainly  for  CPCs  and  youth  collectives.

Problems  with  the  tool  were  not  properly  discussed  in  team  meetings,  so  they  resolved  issues  informally.   However,  the  program  coordinator  is  actively  supporting  the  use  of  the  dashboard  and  MIS  tool.  \nRajasthan  LEDS  \u25cf  LEDS  made  59  entries  in  November,  mostly  focused  on  child/youth  collectives,  parent  collectives,  and  households.  Some  data,  like  work  on  social  protection  and  LRC  enrolments,  was  entered  in  the  wrong  sections.  \u25cf  The  team  was  comfortable  using  the  tool  but  had  trouble  understanding  some  sections  and  uploading  the  right  documents  as  evidence.  A  reorientation  session  helped  \ufb01x  these  issues  and  explained  where  to  enter  speci\ufb01c  activities.  \u25cf  Only  one  of  the  three  team  members  using  the  tool  had  attended  training,  but  she  helped  the  others  learn.

However,  given  that  the  older  team  had  a  good  understanding  of  the  tool  and  they  had  helped  the  new  joinees  in  setting  up  the  tool  and  giving  context,  reorienting  the  team  on  the  tool  was  easier  and  more  effective.  \u25cf  It  was  observed  that  while  they  were  able  to  \ufb01ll  data  into  sections  that  were  familiar  to  them/or  which  \n2  3  4  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.

West  Bengal  \n1.1  CRY  \n Theme  Narrative  \nVeri\ufb01cation  of  current  tool  implementation  \nReview  of  data  entries:  Till  our  visit,  there  were  only  144  submissions  from  CRY.  Most  activities  are  being  done  in  households,  child  collectives,  CPCs  and  parent  collectives. Submissions  from  the  month  of  November  were  reviewed  and  out  of  13+   animators,  only  6  had  made  entries  on  the  activity  MIS  tool. In  them,  only  pictures  were  submitted  as  means  of  veri\ufb01cation,  so  we  could  verify  the  number  of  attendees  from  the  data  entries  on  MIS  which  largely  matched. There  have  been  a  lot  of  cases  being  identi\ufb01ed  on  ground,  but  only  35  of  them  were  registered  on  the  MIS  tool.  There  seems  to  be  a  lack  of  clarity  on  what  evidence  needs  to  be  uploaded  since  there  were  no  meeting  minutes  or  attendance  register  uploaded  on  the  tool.    Observing  data  entry  process  and  assessing  MIS  protocols:  Usage  of  the  MIS  tool  is  not  integrated  into  CRY\u2019s  daily  operations.   While  the  project  coordinator  claims  to  have  instructed  the  team  to  complete  data  entry  by  the  end  of  each  day,  the  \ufb01eld  team  members  have  expressed  challenges  in  meeting  this  expectation.  There  is  no  established  routine  for  data  entry  in  CRY.  While  MIS  protocols  like  pre-de\ufb01ned  ranges  are  mostly  being  adhered  to,  qualitative  remarks  can  be  used  better.  The  tool  is  still  quite  unfamiliar  to  them  since  there  has  not  been  much  usage  and  discussion  around  it  in  the  organisation.    Repeated  errors  and  common  challenges:  \u25cf  Frequent  selection  of  \u201cNO\u201d  in  the  question  -  is  there  an  active  child  collective  in  the  village  when  they  are  \ufb01lling  monthly  meeting  details.   \u25cf  No  attendance  register  or  meeting  minutes  being  uploaded.  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       12\n   Understanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  \nUser  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  Community  mobilisers,  MIS  coordinators  and  the  Program  coordinator  -  all  were  hesitant  while  navigating  the  application.  The  main  gap  that  was  observed  was  the  members  could  not  see  any  value  addition  of  this  tool  into  their  daily  operation.  There  is  a  grave  need  for  a  session  where  examples  are  given  regarding  how  this  tool  could  be  integrated  into  their  program.  Their  lack  of  engagement  has  limited  their  ability  to  assess  its  full  potential  or  bene\ufb01ts,  leaving  their  feedback  primarily  hypothetical  or  based  on  assumptions.  A  few  team  members  were  unfamiliar  with  the  full  range  of  features  the  MIS  tool  offers.  Due  to  insuf\ufb01cient  practice,  some  members  have  forgotten  key  functionalities.  One  team  member  encountered  a  technical  issue  during  the  installation  process  and  was  unable  to  correctly  install  the  MIS  app,  which  further  impeded  their  ability  to  engage  with  and  learn  the  tool.  These  gaps  in  familiarity  and  training  suggest  the  need  for  targeted  interventions,  such  as  hands-on  training  sessions,  ongoing  technical  support,  and  regular  reinforcement  of  the  tool's  relevance  to  their  work.  \nFeedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  team  perceives  the  MIS  tool  as  an  additional  workload  that  requires  extra  time,  which  has  contributed  to  its  underutilization. This  indicates  a  lack  of  awareness  and  understanding  of  the  tool's  functionality  and  potential  bene\ufb01ts.  The  team  does  not  see  a  clear  connection  between  the  MIS  tool  and  their  daily  work,  which  further  diminishes  its  perceived  value.   \nFuture  needs  and  recommendations:  CRY  team  recommended  a  feature  to  view  their  daily  history  of  data  entries,  so  that  they  can  keep  track  of  their  submissions.   \nOn-Ground  Feedback  Collection  \nIdenti\ufb01cation  of  New  Challenges:  MIS  data  entry  is  not  a  priority  for  either  the  \ufb01eld  team  or  the  organisation.  There  appears  to  be  no  dedicated  effort  to  promote  or  enforce  data  entry  at  the  organisational  level.   They  report  that  their  work  often  extends  into  the  late  evening,  leaving  them  insuf\ufb01cient  time  to  complete  the  task.  Despite  these  concerns  being  raised,  the  organisation  has  not  addressed  the  issues  or  implemented  measures  to  resolve  them.   \nPartner-Speci\ufb01c  QA  Process  Review:  With  a  large  team  of  experienced  animators,  CRY  has  established  signi\ufb01cant  reach  and  rapport  within  the  community,  as  evidenced  by  interactions  with  CPC  members.  The  CPC  register  is  well-maintained,  containing  attendance  lists,  signatures,  and  detailed  meeting  minutes  of  good  quality. Attendance  records  for  the  year  showed  that  80%  of  CPC  members  regularly  participated  in  meetings,  re\ufb02ecting  strong  engagement.  While  substantial  work  is  being  carried  out  on  the  ground  with  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       13\n   proper  documentation  and  evidence  collection,  much  of  this  is  not  entered  into  the  MIS  tool.  Field  team  members  seldom  use  the  MIS  tool,  and  data  that  is  entered  is  not  systematically  veri\ufb01ed  by  the  organisation.  When  asked  about  their  veri\ufb01cation  process,  it  was  observed  that  all  data  is  maintained  manually. The  team  organises  activity-wise  information  systematically,  relying  on  \ufb01eld  diaries  to  record  meeting  minutes  and  other  details. This  manual  system  ensures  data  is  captured  at  the  \ufb01eld  level,  but  the  organisation  lacks  a  dedicated  person  to  verify  MIS  entries.  Moreover,  the  team  maintains  daily  diaries  to  document  activities  and  shares  updates  with  the  Project  Coordinator  via  WhatsApp.  These  updates  include  a  narrative  of  the  day\u2019s  events,  supported  by  photographs.  \n \n1.2  BSA  \n Theme  Narrative  \nVeri\ufb01cation  of  current  tool  implementation  \nReview  of  data  entries:  BSA  had  the  lowest  number  of  entries,  with  only  29  recorded  up  to  the  time  of  our  visit.  The  last  entry  was  made  in  the  \ufb01nal  week  of  September,  primarily  covering  child  collectives,  parent  collectives,  and  household  schemes.  Several  errors  were  observed  in  selecting  incorrect  sub-activities.  For  a  few  meetings,  minutes  were  uploaded  along  with  the  total  number  of  attendees,  but  these  minutes  could  not  be  veri\ufb01ed  due  to  the  absence  of  physical  records  at  the  organisational  level.  12  unique  child  cases  were  registered  by  two  CMs,  but  no  follow  ups  had  been  conducted.  The  team  struggled  to  address  our  queries  about  the  MIS  data,  as  the  entries  were  made  over  two  months  ago.     Observing  data  entry  process  and  assessing  MIS  protocols:  BSA  has  a  team  of  \ufb01ve  community  mobilisers,  one  of  whom  joined  after  CMS\u2019s  capacity-building  workshop  and  was  therefore  unaware  of  the  systems  in  place.  The  other  CMs  had  uninstalled  the  SurveyCTO  app  from  their  phones,  re\ufb02ecting  limited  engagement  with  the  tool.  When  asked  to  enter  dummy  data,  the  team\u2019s  unfamiliarity  with  the  tool  was  evident,  as  it  felt  nearly  new  to  them.   Repeated  errors  and  common  challenges:  Since  the  community  mobilisers  are  not  actively  entering  data  or  using  the  MIS  tool,  they  did  not  have  many  queries  regarding  it.   \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       14\n   Understanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  \nUser  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  During  the  visit,  a  comprehensive  orientation  session  on  the  MIS  tool  was  conducted  at  the  of\ufb01ce.  While  this  session  provided  a  good  starting  point,  the  team  will  require  sustained  handholding  support  over  an  extended  period,  coupled  with  regular  feedback,  to  build  familiarity  and  con\ufb01dence  in  using  the  tool.   Feedback  on  MIS  utility:  Due  to  their  limited  use  of  the  MIS  tool,  the  team  found  it  challenging  to  provide  detailed  feedback  or  share  their  opinions  on  its  utility.  However,  the  organisation\u2019s  head  was  highly  impressed  by  the  tool  and  the  capabilities  of  the  dashboard.  They  expressed  a  strong  intention  to  integrate  the  dashboard  into  their  operations,  recognising  its  potential  as  a  valuable  decision  making  tool.   Future  needs  and  recommendations:  A  recurring  theme  in  conversations  with  the  team  was  the  lack  of  effective  communication.  So  a  huge  need  to  ensure  CMS\u2019s  communication  reaches  them  reliably.   \nOn-Ground  Feedback  Collection  \nIdenti\ufb01cation  of  New  Challenges:  BSA  is  still  at  an  early  stage  in  setting  up  their  program  and  reach  in  a  new  operational  area  with  considerable  organisational  challenges.  The  previous  Program  Coordinator  and  our  major  point  of  contact  is  no  longer  looking  into  the  KAWACH  project.  The  team  is  also  spread  across  two  districts,  with  all  the  community  mobilisers  in  one  district  while  the  MIS  person  and  the  organisation\u2019s  head  in  the  other  district.  Along  with  that,  there  are  no  proper  protocols  or  formats  being  maintained  on  the  work  that  is  being  done  on  the  ground.  The  daily  work  is  also  not  being  documented  or  reported.  So  the  \ufb01eld  team  along  with  the  numbers  they  report  at  the  end  of  the  month  is  largely  being  unsupervised.    Partner-Speci\ufb01c  QA  Process  Review:  BSA  is  at  an  early  stage  of  forming  child  collectives,  parent  collectives,  and  CPCs.  Some  meetings  and  mobilisation  sessions  are  done  along  with  linking  community  to  required  documents  and  schemes.  Some  dropout  cases  are  also  coming  out.  However,  there  is  no  proper  documentation  of  these  activities.  The  veri\ufb01cation  process  is  absent  within  the  organisation  due  to  lack  of  protocols  and  organisational  challenges.   \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       15\n   \n2.  Uttar  Pradesh  \n2.1   ROSA  \n Theme  Narrative  \nVeri\ufb01cation  of  current  tool  implementation  \nReview  of  Data  Entries:  During  the  second  Quality  Assurance  visit,  the  CMS  team  reviewed  submissions  from  the  last  30  days  in  the  Activity  MIS  tool.  ROSA  had  recorded  approximately  164  submissions  by  the  time  of  the  visit.  However,  several  inconsistencies  and  incorrect  entries  were  identi\ufb01ed. Only  two  submissions  were  related  to  CPC  monthly  meetings,  and  none  were  recorded  for  SMC  monthly  meetings.  Many  entries  for  awareness  sessions  with  child  collectives  included  all  the  options  for  preparation,  mobilisation,  and  conduct  of  sessions,  with  similar  data  repeated  across  these  \ufb01elds. Submissions  primarily  included  photographs,  with  only  a  few  including  meeting  minutes  or  attendance  registers.  Veri\ufb01cation  of  these  minutes  and  attendance  records  was  not  possible  due  to  their  unavailability  at  the  organisational  level.  However,  CMS  was  able  to  review  a  register  at  one  of  the  CPCs  and  provided  recommendations  on  improving  documentation  practices,  as  the  recorded  meeting  minutes  required  enhancement.  \nObserving  Data  Entry  Processes  and  Assessing  MIS  Protocols:  ROSA  is  still  integrating  the  Activity  MIS  tool  into  their  daily  operations.  During  the  \ufb01eld  visit,  CMS  observed  two  group  meetings\u2014one  with  the  SMC  and  another  with  the  CPC.  Community  mobilisers  faced  challenges  entering  information  about  these  meetings  into  the  MIS  tool,  particularly  when  deciding  whether  to  classify  them  as  multi-stakeholder  engagements  or  speci\ufb01c  stakeholder  meetings.  They  explained  that  SMCs  and  CPCs  often  involve  multiple  stakeholders,  such  as  school  teachers,  the  Sarpanch,  ANM,  and  parents.  This  misclassi\ufb01cation,  also  supported  by  the  Block  Technical  Person,  MIS  personnel,  and  Program  Coordinator,  resulted  in  inaccurate  SMC  and  CPC  meeting  numbers  on  the  dashboard.  This  indicates  a  lack  of  understanding  regarding  the  correct  categorisation  of  activities  in  the  MIS  tool.  Additionally,  the  team  struggled  to  utilise  various  tool  features,  including  the  save  and  edit  functions,  the  refresh  button,  and  auto-syncing.  Despite  these  challenges,  the  qualitative  remarks  in  the  reviewed  submissions  were  insightful  and  provided  a  valuable  understanding  of  the  activities  conducted.  \nRepeated  Errors  and  Common  Challenges:  In  addition  to  the  above,  the  ROSA  team  highlighted  the  following  MIS-related  challenges:  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       16\n   \n\u25cf  Many  forms  were  unintentionally  submitted  when  the  team  thought  they  were  saving  them  for  later,  due  to  the  auto-sync  option  being  enabled.  This  also  prevented  meeting  minutes  from  being  uploaded  promptly,  as  they  were  often  unavailable  immediately  after  sessions.  CMS  resolved  this  issue  by  instructing  the  team  to  disable  the  auto-sync  option  when  saving  forms.  \u25cf  The  team  encountered  dif\ufb01culties  uploading  multi-page  meeting  minutes  as  images.  CMS  recommended  converting  and  uploading  these  documents  as  PDFs  instead.  \u25cf  The  tool  restricted  the  number  of  currently  enrolled  children  in  school  to  50,  which  did  not  align  with  ROSA\u2019s  data  needs. \u25cf  Some  CMs  entered  legacy  case  details,  leading  to  duplicates.  The  Program  Coordinator  said  they  would   provide  a  list  of  these  entries.  \u25cf  Usage  of  \u201cOthers\u201d  in  the  tool  \u25cf  Overall  confusion  regarding  entry  of  awareness  sessions  and  monthly  meetings.  \nUnderstanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  \nUser  Familiarity  and  Training  Gaps:  Conversations  around  the  MIS  tool  revealed  hesitancy  among  the  community  mobilisers,  who  were  unaware  of  many  of  the  discrepancies  identi\ufb01ed  during  the  review.  There  remains  a  lack  of  clarity  about  correctly  categorising  activities  within  the  tool,  particularly  regarding  monthly  meetings  of  institutions  like  CPC  and  SMC,  and  understanding  what  quali\ufb01es  as  multi-stakeholder  engagement. They  were  successful  in  registering  child  cases;  however,   mobilisers  were  unfamiliar  with  newer  options  in  the  case  registration  section,  such  as  those  related  to  vulnerability  mapping  and  case  recurrence.  A  small-scale  training  session  was  conducted  during  the  visit  to  address  some  of  these  gaps  and  provide  immediate  guidance.   \nFeedback  on  MIS  Utility:  The  \ufb01eld  team  found  it  highly  bene\ufb01cial  for  their  routine  activity  reporting.  Additionally,  the  Program  Coordinator  and  MIS  personnel  deemed  it  effective  for  compiling  numerical  data,  tracking  \ufb01eld  staff  activities,  and  generating  reports.   \nFuture  Needs  and  Recommendations:  ROSA  suggested  that  the  frequent  training  sessions  on  the  MIS  tool  have  been  highly  bene\ufb01cial  for  their  team.  They  recommended  conducting  these  sessions  more  often,  with  an  added  focus  on  dashboard  demonstrations  to  further  enhance  their   con\ufb01dence  with  using  the  tool.  \nOn-Ground  Feedback  Collection  \nIdenti\ufb01cation  of  New  Challenges:  ROSA  has  demonstrated  exceptional  progress  in  establishing  its  programme  and  extending  its  reach  in  a  new  operational  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       17\n   area  within  a  short  period.  The  organisation  has  also  been  successful  in  building  strong  relationships  at  the  district  level.  The  CPC  and  SMCs  we  interacted  with  were  proactive  and  showed  signs  of  signi\ufb01cant  strengthening. However,  there  is  room  for  improvement  in  reporting  through  the  Activity  MIS  tool.  The  Project  Coordinator  and  MIS  personnel  were  not  consistently  engaged  in  supporting  the  community  mobilisers  or  monitoring  submissions.  Additionally,  community  mobilisers  are  required  to  complete  two  Google  forms  daily  for  internal  reporting,  which,  combined  with  limited  engagement  from  senior  personnel,  has  impacted  their  ability  to  fully  utilise  the  MIS  tool.  \nFurthermore,  community  mobilisers  do  not  interact  with  all  SMCs  in  their  operational  area  each  month.  Instead,  the  SMCs  are  expected  to  operate  independently  and  conduct  monthly  meetings.  As  a  result,  there  are  delays  in  obtaining  meeting  minutes  from  these  SMCs.  Addressing  these  challenges  will  help  ROSA  further  streamline  its  reporting  and  strengthen  its  overall  programme  delivery.  \nPartner-Speci\ufb01c  QA  Process  Review:  ROSA  has  established  a  structured  planning  system  aligned  with  its  annual  plan  for  the  KAWACH  program.  This  is  broken  down  into  quarterly,  monthly,  and  weekly  plans  that  guide  team  activities.  Daily  planning  and  reporting  are  ef\ufb01ciently  documented  using  their  internal  google  forms  called  -  Forms  1  and  2.  These  forms  are  submitted  weekly  to  the  Block  Technical  Person  (BTP),  who  compiles  the  information  into  an  Excel  sheet.  This  compiled  report  is  then  forwarded  to  the  Project  Coordinator  (PC)  for  veri\ufb01cation  before  being  reviewed  and  submitted  to  the  Director  by  the  MIS  team.  While  the  overall  process  demonstrates  a  strong  commitment  to  structured  reporting,  tangible  evidence  of  data  veri\ufb01cation  by  the  BTP,  MIS,  or  PC  was  not  available  during  the  visit. Verbal  explanations  of  the  process  were  shared,  indicating  an  understanding  of  the  importance  of  veri\ufb01cation  at  all  levels.  To  further  strengthen  this  process,  implementation  of  a  formalised  data  veri\ufb01cation  mechanism  was  recommended.  This  step  will  enhance  transparency  and  ensure  consistency  across  all  levels  of  reporting.  \n \n3.  Bihar  \n3.1  BMVS  \n Theme  Narrative  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       18\n   Veri\ufb01cation  of  current  tool  implementation  \nReview  of  Data  Entries:  From  the  review  of  form  submissions  at  the  back-end,  it  was  observed  that  about  229  entries  were  submitted  for  the  month  of  October  with  activities  surrounding  children/youth  collectives,  SMCs/VECs,  CPCs,  community  and  case  management  accounting  for  56,  27,  101,  8  and  44  submissions  respectively.  It  is  evident  that  partner\u2019s  work  with  CPCs  followed  by  youth  collectives  has  been  widely  conducted  and  reported  while  their  work  with  SMCs  and  the  community  is  not  predominantly  conducted  or  reported.  These  submissions  are  mainly  by  2  CMs  who  have  speci\ufb01cally  been  assigned  the  task  of  data  entry.  The  mobilisers  have  only  uploaded  images  of  the  list  of  attendees  and  of  the  meeting  as  means  of  veri\ufb01cation.  CMS  cross-veri\ufb01ed  these  data  entries  with  physical  records  at  the  BMVS  of\ufb01ce,  including  daily  diaries  maintained  by  community  mobilisers  and  block  coordinators.  These  \ufb01gures  were  found  to  be  largely  consistent  with  the  data  points.  BMVS  also  provided  compiled  formats  \ufb01led  in  their  of\ufb01ce,  such  as  attendance  records  and  activities  list  to  corroborate  the  CPC  and  youth  collectives  data.   \nIt  was  observed  that  while  the  data  for  child/youth  collectives  was  entered  correctly,  no  data  was  entered  under  the  parent  collectives  section,  for  enrollments  in  school/at  the  learning  centre  and  for  social  protection  even  while  the  partner  works  on  these  themes.  For  tracking  cases  using  the  case  management  section,  it  was  noticed  that  while  the  enumerators  had  registered  a  lot  of  new  cases,  no  data  was  entered  for  the  follow-up  of  the  cases.  It  was  also  noticed  that  data  on  a  few  sub-sections  such  as  social  protection  and  community  awareness  was  wrongly  entered  in  some  other  sub-section.  It  was  then  clari\ufb01ed  that  the  social  protection  information  should  go  under  the  activities  with  households  sub-section  and  the  work  on  organising  awareness  campaigns  needs  to  be  reported  in  the  multistakeholder  sub-section.     \nObserving  Data  Entry  Processes  and  Assessing  MIS  Protocols:  During  the  Quality  Assurance  visit,  two  community-level  meetings  were  observed  in  the  Jale  intervention  area\u2014one  with  the  CPC  and  another  with  the  SMC.  Field  observations  revealed  that  community  mobilisers  and  block  coordinators  document  meeting  agendas  and  key  details  in  their  diaries.  School-level  facilitators  also  maintain  records,  while  photographs  of  activities  are  systematically  taken.  The  CPC  meeting  was  well-organised,  with  strong  liaison  observed  between  the  community  and  the  Pradhan. Similarly,  the  SMC  demonstrated  sincere  efforts  in  carrying  out  their  responsibilities.  However,  when  asked  to  enter  details  of  these  meetings,  gaps  in  understanding  the  MIS  tool  were  evident  across  the  team.  There  was  considerable  confusion  about  classifying  these  meetings  into  multistakeholder  engagements  and  individual  stakeholder  activities. A  brief  training  session  at  the  of\ufb01ce  provided  clari\ufb01cation  on  these  issues.  Team  members  were  guided  through  dummy  entries  under  supervision  to  build  their  con\ufb01dence  and  address  immediate  queries.   \nThe  team  was  also  unaware  about  the  newer  features  on  the  MIS  tool  like  case  recurrence  or  children  identi\ufb01ed  during  vulnerability  mapping  in  the  case  registration  section.   \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.

These  gaps  were  attributed  to  the  \ufb01eld  team\u2019s  uncertainty  about  where  to  input  such  information  in  the  Activity  MIS  tool.   \u25cf  Additionally,  incorrect  use  of  the  \"Multistakeholder\"  category  led  to  erroneous  entries,  such  as  labour  of\ufb01ce  visits  being  classi\ufb01ed  as  convergence  meetings.  A  lot  of  SMC  meetings  were  also  entered  into  multistakeholder  activities  hence  the  dashboard  did  not  re\ufb02ect  the  actual  number  of  monthly  meetings  for  SMC.  \u25cf  There  were  a  few  cases  where  Hindi  translation  was  not  being  understood  properly.  \u25cf  All  social  protection  related  work  and  awareness  activities  were  being  entered  in  the  \u201cActivities  surrounding  the  community\u201d  section.   \u25cf  Recently  identi\ufb01ed  cases  were  not  being  registered,  and  follow-ups  on  previous  cases  were  not  being  recorded.  \u25cf  CMs  are  providing  1  or  2  words  in  the  qualitative  remark  sections.  \u25cf  The  mobilisers  are  only  uploading  images  of  the  list  of  attendees  and  of  the  meeting  as  means  of  veri\ufb01cation  \nUnderstanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  \nUser  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  BMVS\u2019s  \ufb01eld  team  showed  hesitancy  and  inconsistent  understanding  of  the  activity  MIS  tool.  For  example,  after  the  CPC  meeting,  CMs  and  the  Block  Coordinator  struggled  to  enter  meeting  details  accurately,  often  omitting  agenda  points  and  misclassifying  responses. Questions  on  key  features  like  partial  save,  editing  before  \ufb01nal  submission,  and  \ufb01le  renaming  highlighted  their  limited  familiarity  with  the  tool.  Only  the  Technical  Person  demonstrated  a  moderate  understanding  of  SurveyCTO,  while  other  staff  showed  minimal  con\ufb01dence. Although  all  team  members  were  aware  of  the  KAWACH  Activity  MIS  Manual,  the  absence  of  physical  copies  or  accessible  digital  versions  meant  they  had  not  reviewed  it.  Conversations  during  the  CPC  and  SMC  visit  also  brought  out  the  gaps  in  programmatic  understanding  like  de\ufb01nitions  of  operational  and  functional  criteria.  This  shows  a  clear  need  for  training  the  new  features  and  overall  practice  on  the  partner\u2019s  part.  The  program  coordinator  also  seems  hesitant  with  regard  to  a  technology  like  the  dashboard  and  was  undercon\ufb01dent  in  exploring  the  features.   \nFeedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  community  mobilisers  believe  that  the  MIS  tool  will  be  bene\ufb01cial  once  all  processes  are  streamlined.  They  feel  that  they  will  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       20\n   become  more  comfortable  with  the  tool  with  additional  practice  and  the  establishment  of  a  data  entry  culture  within  the  entire  team.  \nFuture  needs  and  recommendations:  Given  the  signi\ufb01cant  confusion  around  categorising  activities  as  multi-stakeholder  or  single-stakeholder,  BMVS  recommended  the  development  of  a  concise  two-page  note  with  clear  examples  to  provide  practical  guidance  and  improve  understanding. This  resource  would  help  ensure  consistency  and  accuracy  in  data  entry.   They  also  requested  assistance  in  identifying  and  resolving  duplicate  or  incorrect  entries.  \nOn-Ground  Feedback  Collection  \nIdenti\ufb01cation  of  New  Challenges:  During  our  interactions,  it  became  apparent  that  BMVS  faces  certain  organisational  challenges.  The  Programme  Coordinator's  limited  technical  pro\ufb01ciency  restricts  their  ability  to  effectively  support  the  Community  Mobilisers,  which  in  turn  reduces  the  utility  of  the  dashboard. Additionally,  the  team\u2019s  heavy  workload  further  limits  their  ability  to  fully  leverage  the  MIS  tool,  compounding  the  challenges  in  its  utilisation.  \nPartner-Speci\ufb01c  QA  Process  Review:  BMVS\u2019s  reporting  operates  through  a  structured  framework  involving  multiple  levels.  Daily  updates  are  shared  via  WhatsApp  groups,  where  activity  photos  with  brief  descriptions  are  posted  on  the  same  day. Meeting  records  are  documented  in  physical  registers  or  daily  diaries,  while  monthly  updates  are  consolidated  into  the  partner\u2019s  internal  Excel  sheet  during  of\ufb01ce  meetings.  Data  is  also  periodically  uploaded  to  the  activity  MIS  tool,  though  not  consistently  on  a  daily  basis.  Despite  this  systematic  approach,  no  concrete  evidence  was  provided  regarding  the  data  veri\ufb01cation  processes  employed  by  the  Program  Coordinator,  and  technical  personnel.  While  verbal  explanations  indicated  that  the  Program  Coordinator  and  technical  staff  occasionally  accompany  \ufb01eld  activities,  no  supporting  documentation  or  records  were  made  available  to  substantiate  these  claims.  \n \n3.2  Centre  Direct  \n Theme  Narrative  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       21\n   Veri\ufb01cation  of  current  tool  implementation  \nReview  of  Data  Entries:  Meeting  minutes,  attendance  list  of  monthly  meetings  were  veri\ufb01ed  using  CD\u2019s  range  of  physical  records  available  in  their  of\ufb01ce.  Overall,  about  299  data  entries  were  submitted  during  the  month  of  October  with  the  majority  (109)  being  on  activities  surrounding  CPCs,  67  were  on  activities  surrounding  youth  groups  (mainly  creating  awareness),  while  a  smaller  number  -  36,  21,  15,  17  -  of  submissions  were  for  activities  surrounding  SMCs,  schools,  learning  centres  and  on  organising  awareness  sessions  with  the  community.  A  handful  of  submissions  (10  and  7)  focused  on  activities  surrounding  parent  collectives  and  other  community  groups. On  reviewing  entries  at  the  backend,  it  was  observed  that  the  quality  of  data  reported  on  CD\u2019s  work  with  CPCs  and  SMCs  was  good  and  appropriate  means  of  veri\ufb01cation  such  as  meeting  minutes  and  pictures  had  been  uploaded  with  most  of  the  submissions;  however  during  the  \ufb01eld  visit  it  was  found  out  that  the  partner\u2019s  work  with  existing  CPCs  was  wrongly  being  entered  in  the  activities  with  inactive  CPCs  section.  It  was  then  explained  to  them  that  the  \u2018work  with  existing  CPCs\u2019  option  should  be  chosen  and  \ufb01lled  while  conducting  any  activity  concerning  existing  CPCs.  CDs  work  on  facilitating  seed  money  support  and  social  protection  was  also  not  reported  in  the  October  submissions.  Confusion  over  submitting  duplicate  entries  owing  to  SSEVS  facilitating  the  livelihoods  work  for  CD  was  claimed  to  be  the  reason  for  it.  It  was  later  explained  to  them  that  they  need  to  report  the  work  done  with  households  in  their  area  even  if  the  technical  partner  is  the  one  helping  implement  it. Similarly,  in  the  case  management  section,  it  was  noticed  that  while  the  data  for  new  case  registrations  was  being  duly  reported,  no  information  was  being  submitted  on  the  follow-up  of  the  cases. The  team  was  then  reoriented  on  the  steps  for  entering  data  while  following-up  on  the  past  cases.   \nObserving  Data  Entry  Processes  and  Assessing  MIS  Protocols:  Field  observations  included  two  community-level  meetings  in  Village  Keni,  Khijarsaray  Block\u2014one  with  a  youth  group  and  another  with  the  SMC  at  a  middle-level  school.  Following  which  CMS  suggested  to  enter  data  on  the  same  in  the  Activity  MIS  tool  along  with  some  other  dummy  entries.  There  was  still  hesitancy  and  discomfort  while  navigating  the  tool  leading  to  incorrect  entry  of  data.  Features  like  partial  save  before  submission,  programmatic  knowledge  between  particular  stakeholder  and  multistakeholder  were  also  limited.  While  the  prede\ufb01ned  input  ranges  are  being  adhered  to,  they  recommended  increasing  the  allowable  range  for  children  currently  enrolled  in  school  in  one  submission  to  over  50.  \n Repeated  Errors  and  Common  Challenges:  \n\u25cf  The  dashboard  \ufb01gures  for  SMC  and  CPC  meetings  were  inaccurate  because  multi-stakeholder  engagement  was  mistakenly  selected  instead  of  single-stakeholder. Community  Mobilisers  explained  that  this  confusion  arose  from  the  involvement  of  multiple  stakeholders  (e.g.,  schoolteachers,  Sarpanch,  ANM,  and  parents)  in  such  meetings.  \u25cf  Doubts  around  the  Hindi  translation  of  certain  English  terms  in  the  questionnaire,  such  as  \"surrounding,\"  led  to  errors.   \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       22\n   \u25cf  CMs  were  wrongly  selecting  \"preparation  for  awareness  sessions\"  instead  of  \"conducting  awareness  sessions,\"  and  choosing  \"Activation  of  inactive  CPCs\"  instead  of  \"Activities  with  existing  CPCs.\"   \u25cf  \u201cPoonam\u201d  name  being  shown  in  their  community  mobilisers  on  dashboard  -  needs  to  be  removed. \nUnderstanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  \nUser  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  Considerable  gaps  in  the  team\u2019s  understanding  of  the  MIS  tool  were  evident.  Many  staff  members  had  not  utilised  the  MIS  manual,  resulting  in  a  lack  of  coordination  and  handholding  support  among  team  members.  This  contributed  to  errors  in  data  entry  and  hesitancy  in  using  the  tool  con\ufb01dently.  Monthly  team  meetings  failed  to  address  these  issues  adequately,  leading  to  informal  problem-solving  efforts  among  staff.  Field  staff  demonstrated  varying  levels  of  familiarity  with  SCTO.  While  the  Technical  Person  showed  a  strong  understanding,  the  Block  Outreach  Worker  and  one  Community  Mobiliser  displayed  moderate  familiarity.  The  team  was  aware  of  the  KAWACH  Activity  MIS  Manual,  but  the  absence  of  physical  or  easily  accessible  copies  meant  they  had  not  reviewed  it.  The  dashboard  \ufb01gures  for  SMC  and  CPC  meetings  were  inaccurate  because  multi-stakeholder  engagement  was  mistakenly  selected  instead  of  single-stakeholder.  Community  Mobilisers  explained  that  this  confusion  arose  from  the  involvement  of  multiple  stakeholders  (e.g.,  schoolteachers,  Sarpanch,  ANM,  and  parents)  in  such  meetings. Continued  training  sessions,  with  a  focus  on  understanding  the  distinction  between  single-stakeholder  and  multi-stakeholder  engagements,  are  necessary. \nFeedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  community  mobilisers  generally  \ufb01nd  the  MIS  tool  user-friendly  and  believe  that  the  current  reporting  system,  along  with  the  dashboard,  will  be  bene\ufb01cial  once  all  data  has  been  entered  and  any  backlog  is  cleared.  They  recognise  that  they  need  to  invest  time  in  exploring  the  tool  further  to  become  comfortable  with  it  and  to  effectively  utilise  the  dashboard  for  tracking  their  progress  against  the  targets  set  for  KAWACH.  \nFuture  needs  and  recommendations:  \n\u25cf  In  the  dashboard,  they  suggest  bringing  detailed  indicators  on  school  level  collectives  since  that  is  a  major  part  of  their  operations. \u25cf  Recommended  introducing  the  option  of  selecting  month  in  case  registration  so  that  backlog  can  be  entered  if  any.  \u25cf  File  uploads  for  training  sessions  to  be  introduced.  \u25cf  Suggested  if  we  can  specify  \u201cRapport  building\u201d  with  Visiting  school,  since  strengthening  school  collectives  also  required  visiting  the  school  which  was  a  cause  of  confusion  in  the  team.  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.

Each  community  mobilizer  is  responsible  for  visiting  5  villages  (15  wards)  per  month,  conducting  15  CPC  meetings,  5  youth  meetings,  5  adolescent  meetings,  and  handling  additional  community-level  activities.  This  high  volume  of  tasks  was  reported  to  contribute  to  delays  in  form  submission  timely.  Secondly,  the  challenges  with  the  tool  are  not  discussed  during  monthly  team  meetings  ,  which  results   in  informal  problem-solving  efforts  among  the  staff.  \nPartner-Speci\ufb01c  QA  Process  Review:  The  community  mobilisers  and  Block  Coordinators  maintain  their  daily  diaries  where  they  record  meeting  agendas,  child  marriage  cases,  participant  details,  and  brief  meeting  information.  Activity  photos  with  brief  descriptions  are  shared  daily  via  WhatsApp  groups.  Activities  are  updated  monthly  in  an  internal  Excel  G-Sheet  by  the  MIS  person  during  of\ufb01ce  meetings,  with  cross-veri\ufb01cation  conducted  through  three  layers  of  review.  Additionally,  a  Kawach  monthly  report  is  prepared  for  internal  documentation,  detailing  all  activities  village-wise,  along  with  the  proceedings  and  a  gender-  and  age-wise  list  of  attendees. CD  demonstrates  strong  record-keeping  and  documentation  practices,  complemented  by  commendable  on-ground  efforts.  The  program  coordinator  is  very  active  and  enthusiastic  in  integrating  the  dashboard  and  the  MIS  tool  in  their  daily  operations.   \n4.  Rajasthan  \n4.1  LEDS \nTheme  Narrative  \nVeri\ufb01cation  of  current  tool  implementation  \nReview  of  data  entries:   LEDS  has  submitted  about  59  entries  in  November,  with  10,  9,  21,  3  and  11  entries  on  activities  surrounding  child/youth  collectives,  parent  collectives,  households,  community  and  multistakeholder  activities.   \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       24\n    Observing  data  entry  process  and  assessing  MIS  protocols:  The  work  of  LEDS  centres  around  social  protection,  school  enrollment,  Learning  Resource  Centre  enrollment,  and  working  with  youth/women  groups  and  anganwadi  centres.  The  same  is  \ufb01rst  entered  in  registers  manually  and  then  entered  in  the  SurveyCTO  application  by  3  people  from  the  organization  who  have  been  designated  for  it.  The  data  is  entered  once  every  2-3  days  after  the  activities  on  the  \ufb01eld  have  been  completed.     Repeated  errors  and  common  challenges:  While  the  team  displayed  ease  with  using  the  application,  certain  gaps  were  observed  in  their  understanding  of  the  sections  in  the  tool. It  observed  that  some  data  points  (e.g.  work  with  parents/households  on  social  protection  or  talking  to  parents  for  entering  their  children  in  the  learning  centres)  that  was  supposed  to  be  entered  in  the  section  on  \u2018Activities  surrounding  households\u2019  or  \u2018Activities  surrounding  remedial  education\u2019  respectively  was  wrongly  entered  in  the  section  titled  \u2018Activities  surrounding  parent  collectives.\u2019  Also,  their  work  on  educating  children  in  the  LRCs  was  not  being  entered  in  the  tool.  It  was  also  seen  that  the  \ufb01eld  team  was  not  uploading  appropriate  documents  for  the  means  of  veri\ufb01cation.  \nUnderstanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  \nUser  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  Of  the  3  people  designated  to  use  the  MIS  system,  1  had  attended  the  training  session  conducted  by  CMS.  Understandably,  the  one  who  had  received  the  training  seemed  to  be  more  con\ufb01dent  in  using  the  tool  than  the  other  members.  Nonetheless,  she  had  built  the  capacities  of  the  other  \ufb01eld  workers  to  download  the  application  and  use  it  quite  effectively.  It  was  observed  that  the  team  was  able  to  navigate  through  the  application  quite  easily,  however  challenges  were  noticed  in  their  understanding  of  using  the  different  sections  of  the  tool. To  address  such  issues,  the  team  was  oriented  on  the  sections  relevant  to  them  again  so  that  they  can  enter  information  in  the  tool  correctly. It  was  highlighted  to  them  that  work  done  on  a  daily  basis  on  educating  the  children  in  the  LRCs  should  be  entered  in  the  \u2018other  activities\u2019  sub-section  of  the  \u2018Activities  surrounding  remedial  education\u2019  section  and  that  data  on  awareness  drives  conducted  in  the  community  should  be  entered  in  the  multistakeholder  section.   The  program  coordinator  was  also  oriented  on  using  the  dashboard  to  effectively  track  the  data  being  entered  by  the  \ufb01eld  team.     Feedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  \ufb01eld  team  and  the  program  coordinator  found  the  SurveyCTO  tool  quite  useful  for  reporting  of  the  work  that  they  do  on  the  ground.  The  entire  team  showed  enthusiasm  for  using  the  tool  and  learning  how  to  use  it  more  effectively.   \nFuture  needs  and  recommendations:  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       25\n   Post  reorienting  on  the  tool,  the  team  mentioned  that  they  will  now  onwards  enter  data  in  the  appropriate  sections  and  upload  the  means  of  veri\ufb01cation  correctly  as  well.  They  did  not  provide  any  recommendations  on  improvising  the  tool.   \nOn-Ground  Feedback  Collection  \nIdenti\ufb01cation  of  New  Challenges:  Apart  from  the  challenges  listed  above,  no  major  new  challenges  were  identi\ufb01ed  in  this  QA  visit.    \nPartner-Speci\ufb01c  QA  Process  Review:  Overall,  the  LEDS  team  seemed  to  be  quite  at  ease  with  the  application  and  eager  to  use  the  tool.  However,  the  main  challenges  concerned  getting  clarity  on  which  section/sub-sections  should  be  used  for  reporting  the  work  that  they  engage  with  the  community  and  on  uploading  the  correct  means  of  veri\ufb01cation. All  such  doubts  were  resolved  by  reorienting  the  team  on  the  sections  relevant  to  them.     \n4.2  Taabar  \n Theme  Narrative  \nVeri\ufb01cation  of  current  tool  implementation  \nReview  of  data  entries:   Taabar  being  a  shelter  home,  only  the  case  management  section  of  the  tool  is  relevant  for  them.  They  have  submitted  about  15  entries  in  the  month  of  November  with  all  the  previous  case  management  information  being  shared  with  the  CMS  team  through  the  legacy  data.    Observing  data  entry  process  and  assessing  MIS  protocols:  2  members  from  the  Taabar  team  had  attended  the  training  on  the  tool.  The  members  mentioned  that  they  are  completely  familiar  with  the  data  entry  process  and  protocol  for  case  management  and  have  not  faced  any  issues  till  now  in  entering  data  for  registering  a  new  case  or  following  up  on  it.    Repeated  errors  and  common  challenges:  During  the  visit,  the  issue  of  mismatch  between  the  case  management  numbers  shared  in  the  legacy  data  and  in  the  MPRs  was  discussed  and  the  team  replied  that  they  will  crosscheck  the  data  shared  in  both  -  legacy  and  MPR  -  and  share  the  remaining  data  with  the  CMS  team  at  the  earliest. Numbers  on  child  marriage  (CM)  had  been  wrongly  shared  by  the  Taabar  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       26\n   team.  They  had  assumed  CM  refers  to  \u2018children  missing\u2019.  It  was  then  clari\ufb01ed  that  Child  Marriage  cases  are  to  be  reported  under  CM  and  that  the  numbers  previously  shared  by  them  under  CM  need  to  be  removed  from  the  data.     \nUnderstanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  \nUser  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  The  team  mentioned  that  they  are  able  to  use  the  case  management  system  for  cases  referred  to  them  with  ease.  However,  the  statement  needs  to  be  understood  cautiously  given  that  the  team  has  only  recently  started  using  the  tool  for  reporting  their  work  and  tracking  cases.  Issues  might  crop  up  once  the  team  starts  using  the  tool  regularly,  which  we  ensured  the  team  would  be  suitably  resolved.   \nFeedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  team  found  the  MIS  system  useful  for  tracking  cases  of  children  reported  to  their  organization.  They  were  oriented  to  the  dashboard  as  well  so  that  they  could  easily  track  the  data  entered  on  the  tool  over  time.    \nFuture  needs  and  recommendations:  The  team  did  not  provide  any  suggestions  for  improving  the  application.  Overall,  they  seemed  quite  satis\ufb01ed  with  the  case  management  system  and  mentioned  that  the  present  system  covers  all  the  aspects  that  might  arise  in  the  effective  management  of  the  case.   \nOn-Ground  Feedback  Collection  \nIdenti\ufb01cation  of  New  Challenges:  No  new  challenges.   \nPartner-Speci\ufb01c  QA  Process  Review:  The  partner  reported  that  they  understood  the  application  of  the  tool  for  case  management  quite  well.  However,  given  that  they  have  only  recently  started  entering  the  data  on  the  tool,  they  might  take  some  time  to  get  adept  at  using  it  and  doubts  might  come  up  later  on  which  would  need  to  be  addressed  at  that  time.      \n4.3  Pardarshita  \n Theme  Narrative  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       27\n   Veri\ufb01cation  of  current  tool  implementation  \nReview  of  data  entries:   As  compared  to  October,  the  Pardarshita  team  had  submitted  very  few  entries  (about  10  to  15)  in  November.    Observing  data  entry  process  and  assessing  MIS  protocols:  The  1st  QA  visit  had  revealed  that  the  Pardarshita  team  had  established  excellent  MIS  protocols  by  designating  1  person  at  each  LRC  for  this  MIS  work,  maintaining  separate  registers  diligently  for  all  their  work,  and  specially  scheduling  time  at  the  end  of  the  week  for  updating  all  the  weeks  work  in  the  tool. However,  this  system  was  not  followed  in  the  month  of  November  owing  to  4  members  (out  of  7)  from  the  \ufb01eld  team  leaving  the  organization  permanently  and  some  opting  for  long  leaves  due  to  personal  events  (like  marriage,  health  issues  etc). It  was  told  that  the  program  team  had  also  asked  to  enter  data  with  some  delay  since  the  coordinator  wanted  to  tally/check  the  data  being  reported  in  the  MPR  and  the  one  being  updated  on  SurveyCTO.  4  new  members  had  joined  the  organization  in  place  of  the  ones  who  had  left  and  they  were  yet  to  be  oriented  on  the  tool  properly. However,  the  program  coordinator  had  ensured  that  the  new  members  download  the  application  and  go  through  the  tool  by  themselves  once.   Repeated  errors  and  common  challenges:  Of  the  total  7  members  from  the  \ufb01eld  team,  only  3  members  were  from  the  older  team  and  were  well-versed  in  using  the  SurveyCTO  application.  It  was  observed  that  while  they  were  able  to  \ufb01ll  data  into  sections  that  were  familiar  to  them/or  which  they  had  used  previously,  they  would  panic  and  hesitate  to  use  the  tool  if  a  new  section  or  new  question  cropped  up  which  they  had  not  answered  before.  Pardarshita\u2019s  work  on  CPCs  is  relatively  new  with  them  taking  initiative  to  form  the  CPCs  at  present. However,  this  data  was  being  entered  in  the  section  on  \u2018work  with  existing  CPCs\u2019.  It  was  explained  to  them  that  work  on  formation  of  new  CPCs  should  go  in  the  section  on  \u2018work  with  new  CPCs\u2019,  however  once  formed  the  work  with  the  CPCs  should  be  entered  in  the  section  on  \u2018work  with  existing  CPCs\u2019.  They  also  mentioned  that  certain  schools  and/or  SMCs  that  they  work  with  are  not  re\ufb02ecting  in  the  tool.  The  list  of  schools  which  needs  to  be  added  in  the  tool  was  shared  by  the  team  and  it  was  discussed  that  this  list  would  be  added  in  the  tool  during  the  next  tool  upgrade  session.  The  case  management  section  of  the  tool  was  not  being  used  to  enter  data  on  dropouts  even  though  the  program  works  on  their  reenrollment.   \nUnderstanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  \nUser  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  Due  to  a  lot  of  new  members  joining  the  Pardarshita  team  and  to  address  the  issues  faced  by  members  from  the  older  team,  the  entire  team  was  oriented  on  the  tool  again.  Each  section  that  is  relevant  to  their  work  such  as  activities  surrounding  children/youth  collectives,  remedial/bridge  education,  households,  schools/SMCs  formation  of  CPCs,  women  groups  and  community  was  explained  in  detail  while  ensuring  that  all  the  team  members  present  are  able  to  understand  and  feed  in  data  in  all  the  sub-sections  appropriately.  It  was  observed  that  the  members  were  entering  data  on  awareness  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       28\n   campaigns  in  the  community  section  but  it  was  emphasised  that  such  campaign  work  will  go  under  the  multistakeholder  section  and  any  other  work  with  the  community  (such  as  identi\ufb01cation  of  dropouts,  cases  of  child  labour)  will  go  in  the  community  section  (for  particular  stakeholder).  The  means  of  veri\ufb01cation  applicable  for  the  work  they  do  and  how  to  upload  them  was  also  explained  clearly.  Given  the  organizations  extensive  work  on  reenrollment  of  dropots.  The  case  management  sections  for  registering  a  case  for  dropouts  and  following  up  with  them  were  also  explained  in  detail.    \nFeedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  program  coordinator  mentioned  that  the  tool  has  been  helpful  to  them  and  especially  appreciated  the  support  provided  by  CMS  in  effectively  using  the  MIS  system.  Citing  factors  out  of  their  control  (i.e.  people  leaving,  personal  events  etc)  for  the  drastic  reduction  in  November  form  submissions,  the  coordinator  said  that  they\u2019ll  ensure  that  the  data  is  entered  regularly  and  on  time  going  forward.  The  coordinator  also  seemed  to  have  made  efforts  in  understanding  the  dashboard  and  asked  several  questions  of  the  indicators  and  the  graphs.  Dif\ufb01culty  in  grasping  English  sentences  quickly  seemed  to  be  a  hurdle  for  them  in  navigating  the  dashboard.  The  dashboard  was  explained  to  the  coordinator  again  and  queries  clari\ufb01ed  (e.g.  on  understanding  indicators  on  functional  operational  CPCs/SMCs)  thereby  further  building  the  capacity  of  the  coordinator  in  using  the  dashboard.      \nFuture  needs  and  recommendations:  The  team  mentioned  that  they  will  regularly  utilize  the  MIS  system  going  forward;  now  that  the  team  was  reoriented  on  the  tool.  However,  they  did  not  provide  any  additional  recommendations  for  improving  the  tool.    \nOn-Ground  Feedback  Collection  \nIdenti\ufb01cation  of  New  Challenges:  The  issue  of  effectively  training  new  members  who  join  the  organization  was  noticed  during  this  QA  visit.  Precise  protocols  could  be  set  to  ensure  the  members  transitioning  out  of  the  organization  are  training  the  new  joinees  on  the  tool  before  they  leave  so  that  work  on  ground  and  that  being  reported  in  the  application  does  not  suffer.   \nPartner-Speci\ufb01c  QA  Process  Review:  Owing  to  different  reasons,  the  MIS  submissions  had  drastically  dropped  in  the  2nd  QA  visit  as  compared  to  the  1st.  The  team  did  not  seem  to  be  adhering  to  the  MIS  protocols  established  earlier.  However,  given  that  the  older  team  had  a  good  understanding  of  the  tool  and  they  had  helped  the  new  joinees  in  setting  up  the  tool  and  giving  context,  reorienting  the  team  on  the  tool  was  easier  and  more  effective. Despite  the  slack  in  submissions,  the  team  seemed  enthused  about  using  the  tool  properly  going  forward.     \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       29\n   4.4   SEWA  \n Theme  Narrative  \nVeri\ufb01cation  of  current  tool  implementation  \nReview  of  data  entries:   The  SEWA  team  submitted  127  forms  in  November,  showcasing  a  drastic  improvement  in  submissions  as  compared  to  the  very  minimal  entries  observed  during  the  1st  QA  visit.  Data  on  their  work  with  the  community,  households,  learning  centres,  households  and  women's  group  was  being  entered  by  the  \ufb01eld  team.     Observing  data  entry  process  and  assessing  MIS  protocols:  Unlike  other  partners,  \ufb01eld  workers  from  SEWA  have  their  work  divided  functionally  -  which  means  that  each  member  is  responsible  for  only  one  kind  of  activity  on  the  ground  (be  it  conducting  SHG  meetings,  household  surveys  etc)  every  time.  Only  work  on  organising  mega  camps  is  done  by  the  team  together.  Given  that  the  team  enters  data  in  the  application  that  they  perform  on  the  ground,  work  on  entering  data  in  the  tool  is  also  divided  functionally.  This  helps  them  in  correctly  entering  the  data  in  the  relevant  sections  as  they  do  have  to  work  with  multiple  sections.  The  fact  that  SEWA  has  a  decided  MIS  person  at  the  main  of\ufb01ce  also  works  to  their  advantage  as  the  of\ufb01cial  checks  and  updates  the  \ufb01eld  workers  on  the  status  of  their  submissions  on  a  regular  basis.    Repeated  errors  and  common  challenges:  One  of  the  main  concerns  of  SEWA  arises  due  to  the  fact  that  the  nature  of  their  work  does  not  align  exactly  with  the  sub-sections  in  the  tool.  As  mentioned  in  the  previous  QA  report  as  well,  SEWA\u2019s  work  with  existing  SHGs  (wherein  meetings  with  1  or  2  SHGs)  are  conducted  every  data  cannot  be  reported  properly  in  the  tool  given  that  the  tool  asks  detailed  questions  only  on  the  work  with  new  SHGs  and  only  few  qualitative  questions  on  their  work  with  existing  SHGs.  The  SHG  section  thus  needs  to  be  restructured  so  that  SEWA  is  able  to  report  their  work  correctly.  The  team  also  mentioned  facing  challenges  in  reporting  their  work  with  women  individually  (particularly  collecting  data  from  them  on  their  livelihoods).  The  team  was  not  sure  in  which  section  this  data  should  be  reported. After  understanding  that  SEWA  is  at  present  surveying  these  women  from  the  women's  groups  by  visiting  their  houses  to  initiate  livelihood  activities  at  a  later  stage,  it  was  mentioned  that  this  activity  could  be  reported  in  the  \u2018other  activities\u2019  sub-section  of  the  section  on  \u2018activities  surrounding  households\u2019  and  their  livelihoods. Similar  to  the  Pardarshita  team,  it  was  observed  that  members  from  SEWA  would  hesitate  to  use  the  tool  in  case  they  counter  any  question  that  they  have  not  seen  before.  Some  of  the  team  members  also  did  not  seem  very  comfortable  with  uploading  images  wherever  required.  It  was  also  clari\ufb01ed  that  their  work  with  the  community  on  organizing  awareness  drives  or  mega  campaigns  should  be  reported  in  the  multistakeholder  section  and  not  in  the  \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       30\n   community  section.  A  pertinent  question  was  on  reporting  for  social  protection  linkages  that  happened  in  mega  camps.  Post  discussing  internally,  it  was  decided  that  while  the  activity  of  organising  a  mega  camp  should  be  reported  in  the  multistakeholder  section,  the  reporting  on  the  number  of  households  linked  to  social  protection  schemes  should  be  entered  in  the  \u2018activities  with  households\u2019  section  of  the  tool.  The  program  coordinator  also  had  an  issue  in  understanding  the  indicator  labeled  \u2018does  the  village/sansad  have  at  least  one  child  collective  who  is  active  and  taking  actions?\u2019  due  to  getting  confused  over  the  meaning  of  the  word  \u2018sansad\u2019  with  bal  sansads  in  school.  It  was  then  explained  to  them  that  the  indicator  is  asking  about  active  child  collectives  in  their  wards  and  has  nothing  to  do  with  bal  sansads.  The  program  coordinator  informed  that  the  list  of  stakeholders  in  the  multistakeholder  section  needs  to  be  updated  as  some  stakeholders  that  are  an  important  part  of  their  multistakeholder  meetings  are  not  listed  in  the  tool  (the  SEWA  coordinator  has  shared  the  list  of  remaining  stakeholders  with  the  CMS  team).   \nUnderstanding  and  Engagement  with  the  MIS  tool  \nUser  familiarity  and  training  gaps:  The  SEWA  team  showed  a  great  improvement  in  using  the  application  in  the  2nd  QA  visit  as  compared  to  the  \ufb01rst. Results  from  tool  reorientation  provided  during  the  1st  QA  visit  were  clearly  evident  in  the  2nd  visit,  with  all  the  members  being  quite  at  ease  with  navigating  through  the  sections  effectively.  Queries  arose  particularly  due  to  the  lack  of  alignment  between  SEWA\u2019s  work  on  ground  (with  SHGs  and  women)  and  the  tool  structure.  Restructuring  and  re\ufb01ning  the  questions  in  the  tool  could  potentially  enable  the  team  to  enter  their  work  in  the  relevant  sections  quickly  and  effectively,  thus  avoiding  any  confusion  on  it.  Which  documents/images  constitute  the  correct  means  of  veri\ufb01cation  was  explained  to  the  team  along  with  the  steps  to  upload  the  images.  The  social  protection  section  for  households  was  also  explained  again  so  that  it  is  clear  to  the  \ufb01eld  workers  that  they  need  to  report  the  number  of  \u2018households\u2019  and  not  \u2018individuals\u2019  and  the  difference  between  households  with  0  prior  scheme  linkage  and  additional  scheme  linkage  is  evident.   New  features  in  the  dashboard  were  explained  to  the  MIS  person  present  and  he  found  them  to  be  extremely  useful  in  tallying  the  data.       \nFeedback  on  MIS  utility:  The  team  reported  being  satis\ufb01ed  with  the  tool,  and  displayed  greater  comfort,  ease  and  interest  in  using  the  application  at  present  as  compared  to  the  last  time.  The  program  coordinator  was  also  largely  satis\ufb01ed  with  the  \ufb01eld  team\u2019s  effort  and  exclaimed  that  the  team  would  use  the  MIS  system  more  productively  if  the  changes  that  they  require  are  incorporated  in  the  tool.   \nFuture  needs  and  recommendations:  The  team  inquired  about  getting  certain  sections  of  the  tool  restructured  and  contextualized  to  their  working  situations  on  ground  so  that  they  can  use  the  tool  effectively.  No  other  suggestions  were  reported  apart  from  this  request.   \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.  Ltd .  (h t t p s : / / c m s . o r g . i n / )       31\n   On-Ground  Feedback  Collection  \nIdenti\ufb01cation  of  New  Challenges:  Apart  from  the  challenges  listed  above,  no  major  new  challenges  were  identi\ufb01ed  in  this  QA  visit.    \nPartner-Speci\ufb01c  QA  Process  Review:  Overall,  the  partner  showed  a  signi\ufb01cant  improvement  in  the  capacity  of  the  \ufb01eld  team  to  use  the  MIS  system  effectively. That  the  team  members  sought  clari\ufb01cation  on  a  lot  of  \ufb01ner  elements  essential  for  data  entry  pointed  towards  the  fact  that  the  members  were  using  the  tool  regularly  and  were  eager  to  get  their  doubts  clari\ufb01ed.     \n \nCatalyst  Management  Services  Pvt.

The objective of these visits was to conduct a thorough assessment across four \nkey areas to establish a comprehensive and inclusive MEL system. This system aims to be well-\nunderstood by all part ners during the gating period and will serve as a foundation for the \nKawach program in the coming years. \n1. Gaining a deeper understanding of the program from the partners' perspective, \nincluding ongoing on-ground progress and program activities. \n2. Evaluating the current MIS systems to track outcomes and activities, understanding of \nC2I indicators and KPIs within the partners, and detailed understanding of their existing \ndata systems and record-keeping practices along with technology awareness. \n3. Providing in-depth guidance to the partners on the MPR format, addressing any doubts \nand queries they had, and gathering inputs on the first draft of the MPR format. This \nincluded discussing challenges faced in filling out the data for June 2024 and identifying \npotential improvements for version 2, which will be used for July 2024 data. The team \nalso gathered feedback and recommendations on preferred technologies and data \nsystems that would be user-friendly for a tech-enabled MIS system. \n4. Identifying gaps in the understanding of indicators, reporting, and technology \ninfrastructure across the partners, as well as the effort required to address these gaps. \nIn addition to these planned activities, the team also took note of any overall concerns and \nquestions raised by the partners to ensure an inclusive approach, providing voice to the \npartners. \nA two-member team visited each state for a period of 3-6 days in each state in the first half of \nJune 2024.  \nThe following summary report compiles our insights and recommendations from the visits to \nall 18 partners across four states into two sections: \nSection 1: A summary of insights, challenges, and recommendations, including a partner -wise \noverview with a quantitative assessment score based on four themes stated above. \nSection 2: A detailed partner-wise qualitative narrative report organised according to the four \nthemes.   \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/) 4 \nSection 1: Summary Report \nUnderstanding of KAWACH, on ground progress on program  \nactivities \n1. Most of the partners have understood the expectations under the KAWACH programme \nand have aligned their work towards protection, prevention and system strengthening \ncompared to our assessment from the visit in May24.  \n2. The progress of program implementation varies across different states and partners. Efforts \nto strengthen systems and institutions have begun, particularly in areas where partners \nalready had a presence. Progress is slower in new regions, as building trust  with the \ncommunity and mobilizing community -based groups takes time. Additionally, some \npartners have relatively new program teams, which may affect their understanding and \nimplementation of the program (such as BSA in WB, ROSA in UP followed by PGS). These \nwill require additional handholding support from the state leads/zonal BAT teams. \n3. On-the-ground activities, such as activating School Management Committees (SMCs), Child \nProtection Committees (CPCs), and youth groups, as well as gradually introducing child \nprotection topics in Self-Help Group (SHG) meetings, have started, especially in areas where \npartners already have an established presence. \nUnderstanding reporting indicators- C2I  \nWhile overall there was an acceptance and understanding of the indicators, nuances on \ndefinitions and inclusions are not clear to all partners and could affect reporting. Hence all KPI \nand indicator definitions must be clearly written. This must be made clearly and \ncomprehensively defined in the MPRs/associated guidebooks/toolkits. \n\u2022 For e.g., where to report elopement, teen pregnancies, consensual live -in \nrelationships within minors, consensual live-in relationships of a minor with an adult, \nand consensual live-in relationships of a minor with an adult or an older adult \no It was discussed that a separate category should be added for these. \n\u2022 Similarly, definition of a survivor \u2013 is it as per FIR or reporting to CPC, community \ngroup, etc.? \no It was decided that formal reporting is not necessary.  Identification of a child as \na victim of any child exploitation would be considered under a survivor. \n\u2022 If a child marriage was stopped but then occurred, should it be counted?  \no It was decided that if it was stopped during outside of a reporting period, it could \nchange in the later reporting period, however, if it was stopped and then the \nmarriage occurred within the same period it would not be reported. \n\u2022 Definition of irregular in school and state wise variation within the definition \no It was decided that state definitions would hold precedence, however it would be \nmade uniform in the gating period (45 days of continuous absence) as well.  \n\u2022 Definition of an SMC or VEC (an equivalent institution in WB) state wise variation \nwithin the definition \no It was decided that the institution definition be broad and inclusive of all states     \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/) 5 \nMPR format feedback  \n1. Overall, the first version of the MPR was well received by most partners, and they provided \nconstructive feedback on adding indicators, requesting clarifications on definition on \nindicators, and asking for a bilingual version (especially partners in the Hindi speaking \nstates). All the changes and feedback will be incorporated in version 2 which will also be \nbilingual. This version will be shared by 31st July 2024. \n2. Almost all partners requested a space for narrative feedback with each KPI category in the \nMPR format. This is often because the partners feel that the numbers do not provide \nadequate justification to the overall effort that goes behind the number and want to explain \nthat better. Especially when they report zero, they feel that it will be perceived negatively \nand want to explain the context through narration. This will also be added in the v2 of the \nMPR format for July 2024 data. \n3. Most of the partners requested the need for an activity-based MIS- this is because in their \nperception the efforts behind the KPIs are often not understood well. Additionally, it will \ncreate systems for them to easily track which may or may not be present for all partners. \nThey also wanted this information on activities with themselves so they could compare \ncumulative progress against their targets. \nCapacity building  \nAs expected, the capacity of the partners in reporting and using technology varied. Larger \norganisations or those with a longer association with BAT showed better preparedness, \nsystems and readiness, while smaller organizations or newly joined partners will need training \nand capacity building on data reporting systems, formats and technology interface. The \npartners who will need higher handholding support include WB (BSA), UP (PGS), Bihar (BMVS, \nCD) and Rajasthan (LEDS, Pardarshita, and Sewa). The detailed partner-wise scores are \nprovided below in the summary reports. \nForeseeable challenges in MEL \nKAWACH work involves system strengthening, there is a reliance on government bodies for \nclarity. For example, the accountability for implementing Mission Vatsalaya in Rajasthan has \nbeen unclear between the Ministry of Women and Child Development and Minist ry of Child \nrights, despite CCP's ongoing efforts to establish this accountability. Until this is resolved, the \noutcomes related to strengthening CPCs may not be achievable, and the efforts made will only \nbe evident through a narrative report.  \nThe team was trying to ascertain from partners the processes, mechanisms and systems on \nhow the data is captured/aggregated for reporting in MPRs and whether the evidence behind \ncould be verified, validated by the partners themselves or by an independent p arty.  For e.g., \nhow is SMC strengthening being tracked by partners (through staff/volunteer participation, \nmeeting attendance/minutes) or whether child protection agenda is being discussed in SHGs \n(through minutes) or how out of school children or irregular children are being tracked. While \nthe processes/evidence behind the numbers varied across partners based on their current MEL \nunderstanding and team capacity/strength, as of now, the indicators around enrollment, social  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/) 6 \nprotection, and livelihoods, rehabilitation, survivors have better evidence-backed mechanisms \ncompared to the other indicators. \nOne challenge that arises in any Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) process during \nsystem strengthening is determining whether the information from existing systems accurately \nreflects the on -ground situation or if there are systemic loopholes in t he reported data. For \ninstance, are the numbers of out -of-school children based on school data underestimated to \npresent more favorable reporting outcomes for the education system? Or are the meeting \nattendances of SMC members merely formalities, possibly involving financial incentives? To \naddress this, partners should provide self-reported scores on the strength of the evidence and \ndata they report through narratives and the MEL system should be agile to include these when \nunderstanding/analysing the progr ess on outcomes. It is also important for partners to \nunderstand this perspective throughout the programme. \nThe program team and partners should use the gating period to continually refine \nimplementation through a prevention lens across vulnerable groups. For example, while \nconsensual sex between teenagers may not be reported or tracked, it is important for on -\nground partners to engage with these vulnerable groups and educate them about \ncontraceptive use to help prevent cases of teen pregnancies which are to be reported. \n  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt.

West Bengal \n1.1 CLPOA (City Level Program of Action)  \n \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf CLPOA operates in 30 sansads across 17 villages within a single panchayat in North 24 Parganas, located 30 \nminutes from Barasat. Having been part of the Prevention of Trafficking program under BAT since April 2022, the \norganisation has a strong understanding of child protection. Under KAWACH, CLPOA has clarity on most activities \nand is currently exploring new activities such as strengthening SMCs and creating child safety corners. While \nCLPOA is a mature organization, there is room for improvement in their proactive efforts to link vulnerable \nhouseholds to schemes. \n\u25cf The organization has successfully formed 32 children's collectives, conducting 1-2 sessions per month with \nadditional quarterly sessions on leadership and awareness. CLPOA has a clear understanding of session \nmanagement, including material preparation, conducting learning activities through games, maintaining attendance \nregisters, documenting meeting minutes, and collecting quantitative data on collective members and their friends \nwho join. \n\u25cf Parents' groups have also been established. \n\u25cf All 30 sansads have established VLCPCs comprising 12 members each. These committees hold monthly sessions \nand act on reported cases by forwarding them to the police. Additionally, CLPOA collaborates with VLCPC \nmembers to create an annual budget for inclusion in the GPDP, which is presented at panchayat meetings. \n\u25cf Awareness camps and campaigns are conducted as needed, often inviting resource people from CWC and DLSA. \nFor awareness on rehabilitation, a resource person from a government counseling clinic is also invited. \n\u25cf Vulnerable children are identified through collectives, parents' groups, VLCPCs, Asha workers, and field visits. The \nmost prevalent issues are dropouts, child marriage, and child labor. \n\u25cb Contributing factors to dropouts include mobile addiction, peer pressure to earn money, lack of parental \nsupervision, alcoholic parents, and lack of documents. Once children drop out, they often engage in labour  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       18 \n \nto support their families financially. \n\u25cb The high number of child marriages is influenced by the distinct marriage laws within the predominantly \nMuslim community. \n\u25cf Dropouts/irregulars above the age of 15 are difficult to work with since the law doesn\u2019t include them and getting \ndocuments for them takes more than usual time. CLPOA has also put this issue forward in the panchayat office. \n\u25cf Animators conduct daily home and field visits, gathering valuable information on community issues. They diligently \nfollow up on irregular, dropped-out, and re-enrolled children, households in the process of obtaining documents, \nand any cases of child marriage through calls and visits. \n\u25cf Missing documents are a significant issue. Animators collect details from households without documents and \nprovide extensive guidance on obtaining them. However, they only occasionally accompany community members \nto expedite the process. \n\u25cf Activities related to SMCs are new to CLPOA. Although SMCs were formed some time ago, they are currently \nnon-functional. Out of 23 schools, only 3 are high schools with SMCs; the others have VECs. CLPOA is currently \nworking to collect the list of all committee members from the schools. They are hesitant about the operational and \nfunctional conditions of the SMCs, given the ground realities. \n\u25cf Vocational training centres for older children are present but around Barasat which is a bit far from their \nimplementing ground. \nCurrent MIS \u2022 With a team of 8 animators, 2 project coordinators, and 1 MEL coordinator, CLPOA facilitates the program on the \nground. Comprehensive systems and various formats are established for data maintenance and reporting across \noperational areas. \n\u2022 Key formats include attendance sheets, meeting minutes, home visit records, case management forms, dropout \nhandling formats, SP documentation tracking, and case management physical registers. \n\u2022 Animators maintain daily diaries and fill up the above formats later. The MEL Coordinator uses those formats to get \nthe data and add it to any reporting formats from BAT\u2019s end.  \n\u2022 Monthly Qualitative reports having summary and outcomes of activities done are also maintained with the next \nmonth\u2019s plan.  \nMPR Feedback \u25cf The team critically analysed all the indicators, clearing out most of the doubts. Overall, they felt the new MPR is \nbetter and easy to report.   \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       19 \n \n\u25cf Requested for activity level MIS since a lot of activities are done on ground to arrive at one KPI, and they feel like \nthose are not getting valued. \n\u25cf Not comfortable with reporting 0s in the MPR. \n \n\u25cf Additions and Queries: \n\u25cb Queries on operational and functional SMCs. \n\u25cb Alternative livelihoods \n\u25cb If a single child has experienced 3 abuses, and the current status of all the 3 cases are taken in a single \nfollow up home visit, how are they supposed to report it?  \n\u25cb Once a child marriage is stopped involving police, the child can be married off the next week from their \naunt\u2019s place. Should that be reported as Stopped? If the marriage is again stopped, is it two marriages \nstopped or one? \n\u25cb Request to add a remarks column \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf If more indicators are added or new formats are created, CLPOA needs a proper run-through of all the new \nindicators for their clarity.  \n\u25cf More clarity on the operational and function indicators for SMC is needed. \n \n1.2 BSA (Bal Suraksha Abhiyan) \n \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf BSA is operating in 15 sansads in 2 blocks of Darjeeling district, covering both plain and hilly tea garden regions. \nBSA was recently onboarded under BAT in April 2024 and comes with a very new team with little experience along \nwith a new geography. Currently they are focusing on understanding the KAWACH program, forming collectives \nand building rapport with the community. However, their progress has been hampered by a series of events, such \nas vulnerability mapping and multiple visits from technical partners and the BAT team. As a result, they face \nchallenges in their operations and require capacity building in activity execution, case management workflows, and \nthe reporting structure under the KAWACH program.  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       20 \n \n\u25cf BSA has successfully formed 5 child collectives to date. Planning and gaining clarity on the next steps with these \ncollectives.  \n\u25cf They have initiated home visits and tea garden visits, engaging with children, trade union leaders, and parents to \ngain insights into community issues. \n\u25cf Identification of out of school children is being done through child collectives and community visits along with \nmapping out the reasons: \n\u25cb Reintegration into schools after covid has been tough. \n\u25cb Some children are not linked to any scheme for various reasons, they end up feeling left out in school and \nhence do not want to go to school. \n\u25cb Most of the community comprises tribal people but their ST certificates are not made. Along with that Birth \ncertificates are also rare.  \n\u25cb Long distance traveling. \n\u25cf They have conducted 5 parent meetings where challenges faced were discussed. 80% of parents don\u2019t have their \ncaste certificate. Animators provide guidance on the procedure for addressing missing documents but there is a \nserious issue of delay in obtaining the documents. Follow-ups are conducted to track the status of documentation \nretrieval. \n\u25cf VLCPCs were established long ago but are currently non-functional.  There is a need to form them again. BSA is \nawaiting a letter from CDPO to the Panchayats to operationalise VLCPCs by the end of the month. \n\u25cf SMCs don\u2019t exist here as well.  Instead, management committees, which are selected rather than elected, are in \nplace. BSA is planning to track the members in those committees so that they can be worked with.  \n\u25cf Main issues prevalent here are adolescents living together, trafficking to Siliguri for domestic labour, Substance \nabuse and irregular children in schools. \n\u25cf Case management workflows are not set up here yet. \nCurrent MIS \u25cf BSA has 4 animators, 1 MEL coordinator and 1 project coordinator who are greatly focused on aligning with the \nvarious activities under KAWACH and its reporting structures. \n\u25cf Meeting minutes are documented in physical registers along with the next planned date of meeting. \n\u25cf Scanned documents of these are given to the MEL person who maintains the digital copies.  \n\u25cf Home visit updates are put on WhatsApp for now, their plan is to make registers for the same. \n\u25cf Monthly qualitative reports are made by compiling and summarizing all the 4 animators' work.  \nMPR Feedback \u25cf Not so positive feedback on the MPR. BSA did not seem comfortable with the KPIs. They were unable to  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       21 \n \nunderstand how data from activities were to be translated and aggregated to get the monthly KPI numbers.  \n\u25cf A lot of KPIs did not make sense to them since their contract with BAT did not have those activities listed. For \nexample, forming survivor collectives, strengthening SHGs, and awareness of financial literacy. \n\u25cf They were not at all comfortable in reporting 0s in the MPR and requested for the activity level MIS.  \n\u25cf Addition: \n\u25cb Remarks column.  \n\u25cb Education tab, 7.1 section - add trade union community leaders or tea garden management.  \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf Capacity Building and training on the activities as well as the reporting format is a necessity for BSA.  \n\u25cf The Case Management workflow should also be made more clear to them. \n\u25cf Clarity on how KPIs emerge from activities and then lead to C2Is is needed. \n \n1.3 CRY - Dooars Jagoron \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf CRY is carrying out its implementation through Dooars Jagoron in the tea gardens of Jalpaiguri. They are operating \nin 83 sansads spread across 3 panchayats. It is one of the most mature organisations in terms of their \nunderstanding of the KAWACH program and its themes, and the child protection domain. Having a large team with \nexperienced animators, CRY-Dooars Jagoron has achieved significant reach and rapport with the community. They \nare also well versed in the processes necessary to bring about a change.  However, like other partners in North \nBengal, they face challenges, unique to the tribal tea garden community they are dealing with which has possible \nimplications on their reporting on KPIs. \n\u25cf The organization has successfully formed child collectives in all 83 sansads, each comprising 25 children. \n\u25cf Monthly meetings are also conducted for the parents' collectives. \n\u25cf VLCPCs and Panchayat CPCs have been established and are mostly functional across the area. Efforts are ongoing \nto strengthen the Block Level CPC, which is currently not functional. Each sansad holds a monthly VLCPC meeting. \n\u25cf Awareness camps are organized as needed, focusing on child protection issues, children\u2019s rights, social security \nschemes, and school dropouts. The organization adopts a multi-faceted approach to problem-solving.  \nFor example: An area has a lot of dropouts initiated by missing documents.  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       22 \n \n\u25cb Now with parents, they will conduct an awareness camp on how to obtain the missing documents, going \nover the details of the procedure. \n\u25cb On the other hand, camps with schoolteachers to raise awareness of RTE 2009 Act which allows for \nchildren\u2019s school enrollment even without documents. \n\u25cf The most prevalent issues in this region are Child labour, child trafficking, irregular children or dropouts, \nadolescents moving out of house to live together and substance abuse. \n\u25cb Living Together: \n\u25a0 The issue of living together is really concentrated in the context of tea gardens in North Bengal. \nAdolescents, when facing any inconvenience at home, mostly choose to move in with their partners \nwithout marriage in the same community. Any combination of age group is seen, the boy being \nolder or the girl being older.  \n\u25a0 This practice is widely accepted in the community, and separating such couples, especially by the \ngirl\u2019s parents, is frowned upon. \n\u25a0 Living together has similar consequences to child marriage, as enrolled children often drop out of \nschool and enter child labor to sustain their lives together. \n\u25cb Seasonal Child Labour: \n\u25a0 The months of summer are the plucking season for tea leaves. Children during summer vacation get \ninvolved in this activity for their own pocket money. Parents do not coerce them, but the result is a \nnoticeable rise in child labour during this period. \n\u25cb Child trafficking: \n\u25a0 Child trafficking and child sexual abuse (CSA) are deeply hidden issues within these communities. \nAwareness campaigns have gradually brought these issues to light. Traffickers, referred to as \n'agents,' often target children in Jalpaiguri, promising better education in Sikkim but ultimately \nplacing them in domestic labor. \n\u25a0 The agents maintain good relationships with the parents and even take them to see off their child in \nSikkim. Law enforcement faces challenges in addressing these cases due to parental consent, as \nparents often believe they are providing better opportunities for their children, not realizing the \ntrue nature of trafficking.  \n\u25cb Substance Abuse: \n\u25a0 11\u201316-year-old children get into consumption of alcohol and various kinds of drugs. \n\u25cf Dropouts are identified through daily interactions with the collectives, schools, anganwadis, parents, and the  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       23 \n \ncommunity. Animators actively enroll dropouts and conduct regular follow-ups to ensure their continued \neducation. \n\u25cb Through a study they conducted, they found out that boys are way more susceptible to dropouts while girls \nare a bit more disciplined. \n\u25cb Children are not getting good knowledge on basic numeracy and language during their preprimary and \nprimary standards. Hence when they graduate to higher classes, they are not able to grasp advanced topics \nand eventually lose interest and drop out.  \n\u25cb Schools are far away from the tea gardens; hence transportation becomes a problem. \n\u25cb As parents go out to work in the morning and return in the evening children are left unsupervised \nthroughout the day. This lack of supervision contributes to irregular school attendance and higher dropout \nrates.  \n\u25cb Missing documents are an issue faced here as well. The delay in obtaining the documents is exacerbated \nbecause of parents being daily wage workers.  When they visit the centre or panchayat to get their \ndocuments made, they are often asked to make more visits. This would mean they have to choose to let go \nof their daily wage for several days, which many cannot afford. \n\u25cf The organization has identified that there is a major gap in parents\u2019 perspectives on their children\u2019s education and \ncareer. To address this, they have planned to develop Parenting Models where parents will be educated on how \ntheir absence contributes to dropouts and other cases of exploitation. They are also planning to strengthen the \nrelationships among teachers, students and parents to collaboratively address the issue of dropouts. \n\u25cf SMCs don\u2019t exist in high schools. Some management committees are set up and Village Education Committees \n(VECs) operate in primary schools. The organization is facing difficulty in working with education institutions since \nthey are so little functional. So, they are working to strengthen them by identifying members and planning initial \nsessions. \n\u25cf The organization is planning to create school safety nets through school development plans, developed in \ncollaboration with the panchayat, teachers, and school committees. \n\u25cf Learning centers exist and dropouts or irregular students who need extra support are linked to these centers. But \nbridge courses are not provided by the schools. \n\u25cf Children cabinets, Kanyashree club, eco club exist in most of the schools. They are trying to bring about change by \nstrengthening these.  \n\u25cf Animators guide families through the process of obtaining documents needed to access social security schemes, \nsometimes accompanying them based on the need.  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       24 \n \n\u25cf Vocational training centers are identified, but they offer skills such as hotel management and beautician courses \nfor children over 18. Very few centers are available for computer learning or spoken English for those under 18. \nThis would impact their reporting on this relevant KPI. \n\u25cf The organization tracks vulnerable households through daily home visits, identifying at-risk children, dropouts, and \nother cases. These visits also build awareness and provide guidance on obtaining necessary documents. \n\u25cf CRY- Dooars Jagoron has a well-established case management workflow. Once a case is identified, it is \nimmediately reported to the VLCPC for further action. \n\u25cf Mass enrollment camps are organized during school admission periods to ensure maximum student enrollment \n\u25cf Migration registers are being created for all sansads, with 11 completed so far. \n\u25cf The organization does not directly work with SHGs and does not provide seed money or microloans. \n\u25cf Survivors\u2019 collectives are impossible to form according to the project coordinator. Survivor numbers are low and \nthey might be from sansads which are far away from each other. Moreover, they also raised the fact that the \nidentity of a child involved in a POCSO case cannot be revealed by law and hence they can\u2019t be part of these \nsurvivor collectives. \nCurrent MIS \u25cf With 16 animators, 2 MEL coordinators and 2 project coordinators, Dooars Jagoron has a large team involved in \ntheir rigorous routine of daily activities. \n\u25cf Daily activities are divided into two sessions - Morning and Afternoon. The morning session comprises activities \nlike visiting the GP office, contacting ICDS, Asha workers etc. Does not involve home visits since parents are not \navailable. The afternoon session comprises activities like collective meetings, group meetings, home visits. \n\u25cf Animators maintain their daily diary, compile their data into multiple physical formats and register later. \nAfterwards, the MEL coordinators digitize the same into excel sheets. \nMPR Feedback \u25cf Not so positive feedback on the MPR. BSA did not seem comfortable with the KPIs. They were unable to \nunderstand how data from activities were to be translated and aggregated to get the monthly KPI numbers.  \n\u25cf A lot of KPIs did not make sense to them since their contract with BAT did not have those activities listed. For \nexample, forming survivor collectives, strengthening SHGs, and awareness on financial literacy. \n\u25cf They were not at all comfortable in reporting 0s in the MPR and requested for the activity level MIS.  \n\u25cf Addition: \n\u25cb Remarks column.  \n\u25cb Education tab, 7.1 section - add trade union community leaders or tea garden management.   \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       25 \n \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf The team critically analyzed all the indicators, clearing out most of the doubts. Overall, they felt the new MPR is \nbetter and easy to report.  \n\u25cf Requested for activity level MIS since a lot of activities are done on ground to arrive at one KPI, and they feel like \nthose are not getting valued.  \n\u25cf Not comfortable with reporting 0s in the MPR. \n\u25cf Additions and Queries: \n\u25cb Panchayat officials/representatives in 7.1 education tab \n\u25cb Remarks column \n \n1.4 SPMUS (Suprava Panchashila Mahila Uddyog Samity) \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf SPMUS is currently working in 17 sansads spread over 2 Gram panchayats in 1 block in the Bangladesh border \nregion of Murshidabad district. They face prevalent issues of child trafficking and child marriage, influenced by \ncross-border interactions and a population adhering to distinct marriage laws. Additionally, existing community \nstructures (based on religion, and caste) also influence these. SPMUS, being in this space for quite some time, has a \nstronghold on the activities and rapport with formal institutions and stakeholders. They leverage their knowledge \nand reach to advocate and conduct various sessions at the grassroot level involving resource people from district \nlevel, legal institution, police, etc. They effectively navigate challenges through their contacts, continuously \nstrengthening various systems and institutions along the way. Overall, SPMUS is a mature organization in terms of \nunderstanding the KAWACH program and its operations. \n\u25cf They have successfully established 34 Child 'Clubs' across various sansads, with two clubs per sansad. These clubs \nhold bi-monthly sessions facilitated by SPMUS, adhering to the modules provided by BAT. Each sansad has a core \ngroup of three children responsible for mobilising and informing their peers about the sessions, ensuring active \nparticipation and engagement. Along with club members, often their friends also turn up in these meetings. Plans \nare underway to form Youth Collectives for children who have crossed the age of 18, providing a platform for \ncontinued support and development. \n\u25cf Parent Collectives are already formed. Monthly meetings are conducted to educate parents on laws, schemes, \nexploitation cases.  These sessions aim to empower parents with knowledge and resources to better support their  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       26 \n \nchildren.  \n\u25cf SPMUS conducts need-based sessions with Panchayat members, initiated through proposals sent to the \npanchayats. SPMUS team and PRI members coordinate on the date of the session and then all members of the \npanchayat are mobilised, by both Pradhan/Secretary and the animators of SPMUS. These meetings, occasionally \nattended by the Executive Officer, cover critical issues such as exploitation cases, laws, schemes, roles and \nresponsibilities of the PRI members in handling exploitation cases. DCPU, CWC units and ISDP are also approached \nas needed. \n\u25cf VLCPCs are already set up.  \n\u25cb VLCPC members involve SPMUS animators in their monthly meetings. These focus on discussing cases and \naddressing challenges encountered during case reporting. Regular contact with CWC, DCPU, and the police \nhelps mitigate these challenges. ISDP coordinators are contacted from the panchayat who liaise with \nExecutive Officers regarding the utilization of funds allocated for child protection cases. \n\u25cb VLCPC capacity building sessions are tailored around various topics determined by SPMUS. For sessions on \nlaw, policy, and legalities, the organization contacts DCPU and CWC to provide resource persons, making \nthe sessions interactive and engaging through activities and feedback. \n\u25cf An annual convergence meeting at the district level is planned in collaboration with DCPU and CWC. Invitations \nwill be extended to various district level departments through a letter by DCPU including the ADM, DLSA, labor, \neducation, and medical departments, along with local NGOs and child helplines. Stakeholders from the police \ndepartment like Superintendent of police will also be invited.  \n\u25cf Dropouts/irregular/out of school children are identified through their child clubs and home visits. Schools don\u2019t \nprovide any data on dropouts.  \n\u25cb Many parents are farmers who struggle to understand the value of education. The poor financial conditions \nof households often compel children to engage in labor to supplement the family income. This economic \npressure leads to a tendency to prioritize immediate earnings over long-term educational benefits, resulting \nin high dropout rates. \n\u25cb Phone addiction is on the rise which keeps them distracted from education.  \n\u25cb The lack of job opportunities in West Bengal influences parental attitudes towards education. \u201cIf there are \nno jobs in the market, how will education help our children? Better they migrate with fathers and earn some \nmoney\u201d is often heard from parents. \n\u25cb The region has a significant Muslim population, where different marriage laws are followed. This results in \nfrequent child marriages, and in many cases, in-laws do not permit child brides to continue their education,  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       27 \n \neffectively ending their schooling. \n\u25cb Lack of documents, mainly aadhaar and birth certificates, also pose a barrier to enrollment. \n\u25cf Children in need of extra support are linked to free courses provided by locals. SPMUS recognises the need for \nformal remedial education / bridge course centers to be established.  \n\u25cf Dropouts/irregulars above the age of 15 are difficult to work with since the law doesn\u2019t include them and getting \ndocuments for them takes more than usual time.  \n\u25cf The organization faces significant difficulties in collaborating with the education department. While School \nManagement Committees (SMCs) exist in most high schools, the members and their roles remain unclear. To date, \nthe organization has only managed to meet with teachers from one school. In primary schools, Village Education \nCommittees (VECs) no longer exist, and the main contacts are now sub-inspectors or head teachers. Additionally, \nteachers are often uncooperative, requiring permission from higher authorities.  \n\u25cb These challenges were raised by SPMUS at an NGO forum conducted by the Additional District Magistrate \n(ADM). A letter will be issued to SPMUS granting permission to address exploitation cases and educational \nissues, which can be presented when encountering barriers. \n\u25cf They have conducted various sessions with school children and are planning to conduct sessions on Safe touch in \nthe coming months. They also work to strengthen student collectives like Meena Manch.  \n\u25cf SPMUS puts in efforts for identifying households and children without essential documents and guiding them \nthrough the documentation process. Animators assist families with online applications and maintain follow-ups \nwith the DM office. GP members are contacted as needed, and documentation updates are managed through \nWhatsApp, with the MEL coordinator tracking progress online. \n\u25cf The organization has identified vocational centers and efforts are being made to link older children (17.5 years and \nabove) with them.  \n\u25cf Comprehensive case management is conducted in collaboration with formal institutions. This includes home visits \nfor both new and ongoing cases, ensuring survivors receive counseling support and access to rehabilitation homes. \n14 children are currently on board in these counseling sessions. \n\u25cf Sometimes, monetary support through in kind resources are provided to survivors like school uniforms, books, etc.  \n\u25cf Survivor collectives will be formed. \n\u25cf SHGs are not directly worked with. \n\u25cf There is not much work in the livelihood domain. \nCurrent MIS \u25cf With a team of 8 animators, 1 project coordinator, and 1 MEL coordinator, SPMUS effectively facilitates the  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       28 \n \nprogram on the ground. Comprehensive systems and various formats are established for data maintenance and \nreporting across operational areas. \n\u25cf Monthly plans guide animators in scheduling activities and home visits. Animators maintain daily diaries and later \ncompile their data into multiple physical formats and registers. The MEL coordinator then digitizes this information \ninto Excel sheets. \n\u25cf Key formats include attendance sheets, meeting minutes, home visit records, case management forms, dropout \nhandling formats, SP documentation tracking, and case management physical registers. \nMPR Feedback \u25cf The feedback on MPR is positive with no questions regarding the indicators.  \n\u25cf They requested an activity level reporting format since the current MPR is only at the aggregated KPI level. \n\u25cf Case management workflows for them to keep track of follow-ups and current status of a case is also requested. \n\u25cf The addition of a remarks column was also raised. \n\u25cf Not comfortable with reporting 0s in the MPR. \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf No such issue is faced in understanding indicators or definitions in MPR. \n \n2. Uttar Pradesh \n2.1 ROSA (Rural Organization for Social Advancement) \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf The organization is currently working in Balrampur district, focusing on two specific blocks. Within these blocks, \nthey're working across 30 villages, collaborating with 26 Gram Panchayats. Since, the organizations\u2019 geography has \nbeen changed hence it\u2019s affecting their pace of work and achieving outcomes.  \n\u25cf Till now they\u2019ve spent most time and efforts in settling down in the new district and building rapport with the \ncommunity. The team has completed the following activities within a period of 6 months:  \n\u25cb PRA and survey of households \n\u25cb Rapport building with community  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       29 \n \n\u25cb Formation of community groups \n\u25cb Liasoning with district-level line departments \n\u25cf One formation/reformation meeting has been conducted with all the groups including CPWCs and SMCs. \n\u25cb 30 adolescent groups \n\u25cb 30 parent groups \n\u25cb 30 children\u2019s groups  \n\u25cb 26 CWPCs \n\u25cb 28 SMCs \nAll the CWPCs and SMCs are currently not operational. \n\u25cf The organisation has also worked on creating safe corners in school for girls, training module formation on child \nprotection for children\u2019s groups, parents groups, training of govt officials and parents, campaigns on child marriage \netc.  \n\u25cf The organization doesn\u2019t directly confront the community for case management, they go through a proper official \nchannel to tackle such cases. \n\u25cf Since their field location in Balrampur is both a flood-prone area and a new geography for the team, the pace of \nwork has been slower compared to other organizations in Uttar Pradesh. \nCurrent MIS \u25cf The team has the following structure: Community Mobiliser -> Block Coordinator -> MIS manager -> Program \nManager \n\u25cf They\u2019ve divided the whole year work plan in following manner: Whole year plan -> Quarter wise -> Monthly plan -> \nWeekly (for CMs) -> weekly meetings \n\u25cf The current reporting structure involves a manual process. Field staff submits weekly plans (Form 1) and progress \nreports (Form 2) on paper. Block coordinators then manually gather this information and enter it into a monthly \nExcel spreadsheet. Finally, the MIS team and program manager take the information from the spreadsheets and \nformat it according to the BAT's current reporting format. Additionally, they create a narrative report to provide \nfurther context. This multi-step, paper-based system can be time-consuming and prone to errors. \n\u25cf The current reporting structure takes approx. a week\u2019s time at each level just to collate and report the information \nwhich is impacting their time and efforts to be used in the field.  \nMPR Feedback \u25cf The team shared that they liked the proposed MPR format which has given them a clear idea of what needs to be \nreported and when. \n\u25cf Though they were skeptical about the value their organization will get from this MPR. How will the work of the  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       30 \n \ngrassroots level team get effective and easier with this? \n\u25cf The team wanted to access the data after submission and receive feedback on the submitted report to make \nimprovements and enhance their activities. \n\u25cf They want the addition of a comment section in front of indicators. \n\u25cf The team shared the concern of having numerous technical partners which reduces available time for community \nengagement. This can lead to delays in report completion, creating additional challenges for the team. \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf The project team requires training of field team on technical aspects to make reporting time saving and easy for \nthem \n\u25cf Most of the team members are above graduates and have experience of more than 3 years. They also have basic \nknowledge of computers.  \n\u25cf Team members emphasized the importance of capacity building for community mobilizers in data analysis and \ninterpretation. This will equip them to understand the data they collect, gain insights into their target populations, \nand effectively measure project achievements. \n \n2.2 MSEMVS (Manav Sansadhan Evam Mahila Vikas Sansthan) \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf The organization is currently working in Chandauli district, focusing on two specific blocks. Within these blocks, \nthey're working across 50 villages and 37 gram panchayats, out of which 33 are their older villages where they \nworked previously with BAT.  \n\u25cf In the previous phase, the work was focused on a few families at the panchayat level, but it has now expanded to \ninclude all families in the village. The advantage of continuing in the original geography is the established familiarity \nwith stakeholders at the village and block levels, making liaison efforts more efficient. Additionally, 70% of the team \nmembers have been retained from the previous project, ensuring continuity and leveraging their existing \nexperience and relationships. \n\u25cf From February to March 2024, a Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) was conducted, followed by a household \nsurvey and the formation of groups in April and May. In June 2024, capacity-building activities were carried out for \nthese groups. A total of 7,083 families have been identified in the high and medium risk categories.  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       31 \n \n\u25cf The team has established several key community groups within each village: a Community Vigilance Committee \nconsisting of 30 members, Self-Help Groups (SHGs) with 10-15 members, a Children\u2019s Forum for ages 6-14 with \n10-15 kids, and Youth Groups for those above 14 years with 10-12 members. \n\u25cf The team has identified two cases of child marriage and one case of child trafficking. Additionally, they have \nrecognized 250 cases as being high risk. \n\u25cf With the community groups, their team has completed one formation meeting. Additionally, with the CPWCs and \nSMCs, they have conducted one reformation meeting and one training session. \n\u25cf During the field visit to one of their sites we could observe the kickstart of the work where they\u2019ve appointed \nleaders for the community groups formed. \nCurrent MIS \u25cf The team has the following structure: Community Mobiliser -> Program technical expert -> MIS manager -> \nProgram Implementation lead -> Project Director \n\u25cf They have structured the entire year's work plan by dividing it into different levels: quarterly plans at the program \nlead level, monthly plans for the Block Technical Officer, and detailed monthly plans at the individual CM level, \nwhich include specific daily activities. \n\u25cf The current reporting structure involves multiple components: Village profile registers maintained by Community \nMobilizers (CMs) capturing both Target Data and Achievement data. Google Forms are utilized for daily reporting \non various aspects including Community Group Meetings, trainings, entitlements, case studies, livelihood \nassessments, and migration registers. All this information is compiled at the block level manual plus in excel sheets. \nSubsequently, an MIS person and program officer oversee the digitization process, transforming these data inputs \ninto a cohesive final dashboard and comprehensive reports. \n\u25cf Case management registers are maintained at community mobilizer level. \n\u25cf Currently, the MIS process consumes about one week per month for both the Community Mobilizer and the Block \nTechnical Person. Additionally, the MIS Person and Project Manager dedicate approximately 10 days each month \nto this task. \nMPR Feedback \u25cf The team expressed appreciation for the proposed MPR format but are concerned regarding the compatibility \nbetween their existing MIS system and the proposed format. \n\u25cf The team wants the addition of a comment section alongside indicators to provide justification for numbers that \nare reported quarterly or under special circumstances. \n\u25cf They mentioned the addition of an indicator on the number of trainings of CPCs and SMCs, indicator for district \nlevel meetings for CPCs, SMCs and advocacy meetings.  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       32 \n \n\u25cf The team raised concerns about the quarterly observation and reporting of indicators, as this may result in zero \nentries for certain indicators during some months. This could potentially demotivate the team and undermine the \nefforts made towards achieving the desired outputs and outcomes. \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf They need capacity building to effectively capture and identify case stories for community mobilizers, technical \ntraining for ground staff on using technical tools, improved time management skills for efficient reporting, and \ncomprehensive data management and storage training for community mobilizers. \n\u25cf Most of the team members at the CM level are graduates and have experience of more than 3 years. The people at \nblock and head office levels are postgraduates with an average of 7 to 10 years of experience.  \n \n2.3 PGS (Pragati Gramodyog Evam Samaj Kalyan Sansthan) \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf The organization is currently working in Prayagraj, focusing on two specific blocks. Within these blocks, they're \nworking across 40 villages and 38 gram panchayats, out of which 24 are their older villages where they worked \npreviously with BAT.  \n\u25cf They also have the advantage of continuing in the original geography as they\u2019ve established familiarity with \nstakeholders at the village and block levels, making liaison efforts more efficient. Additionally, all of their team \nmembers have been retained from the previous project, to ensure continuity and leveraging their existing \nexperience and relationships. \n\u25cf Up to this point in the project timeline: In January and February 2024, training sessions facilitated by BAT were \nconducted. During March and April 2024, vulnerability mapping was completed for 11,000 households, identifying \n6,361 families categorized in red and 2,500 in yellow. In May and June 2024, efforts focused on establishing youth \ngroups, adolescent groups, and reforming Self-Help Groups (SHGs), while raising awareness on school education, \nchild labour, child protection, and substance abuse prevention. \n\u25cf The team has established several key community groups within each village: including forming 22 adolescent girl \ngroups and 9 youth groups, revitalizing 138 Self-Help Groups (SHGs), and providing training to strengthen 58 \nVillage Level Child Protection Committees (VLCPCs). They have also conducted training for 38 School Management \nCommittees (SMCs), with 18 now operational. Each village now has a tailored action plan, ensuring focused  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       33 \n \ndevelopment efforts at the grassroots level. \n\u25cf The team has identified 35 survivors for livelihoods. \nCurrent MIS \u25cf The team has the following structure: Community Mobiliser -> Program expert -> MIS manager -> Program officer \n\u25cf There is no clear division of the action plan with targets between team members, just a Gantt chart with monthly \nactivity planning is shared within the team. \n\u25cf At the CM level, each activity requires a separate form, which is then compiled into a weekly report for discussion \nduring meetings. This compilation and digitalization are handled by the program officer and MIS personnel. Notably, \nthere is no compilation of information at the block level. \n\u25cf During the discussion, a critical gap was identified: the team failed to demonstrate how planning decisions cascaded \ndown to the Community Mobilizer (CM) level and lacked documented evidence of target allocation. The current \nsystem centralizes data compilation at the MIS and Program Officer level, leaving CMs and block-level staff \nprimarily responsible for gathering activity forms and forwarding them to the head office, which limits their \nawareness of their performance and achievements. \nMPR Feedback \u25cf The team expressed appreciation for the proposed MPR format but are concerned how they\u2019ll report the numbers \nsince their current reporting structure doesn\u2019t collect all those numbers at the ground. \n\u25cf The team wants the addition of a comment section alongside indicators to provide justification for numbers that are \nreported quarterly or under special circumstances. \n\u25cf They want to have a format for ground level reporting. \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf The organization requires capacity building to enhance the technical skills of its team and to develop a robust \nManagement Information System (MIS) within the organization. \n \n3. Bihar \n3.1 SSEVS (Samagra Shiksha Evam Vikas Sanstha) \nTheme Narrative  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       34 \n \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf The organization started with working on land rights and then moved to work on livelihoods and education. On child \nprotection, they first worked on reintegration of survivors but now the focus has shifted to education.  \n\u25cf Under BAT, they work as a technical partner for livelihoods (for economic resilience) in Bihar and on reintegration as \nwell. However, the reintegration work is being phased out and will end in December. \n\u25cf At present, they are working with 148 families across 4 districts. They conducted a scoping study in the beginning to \nidentify problems. They understood that working on vegetable farming yields good income for the families hence \ndecided to work on that. They do not give seed money directly but support farmers by giving actual vegetable seeds \n(of okra, cauliflower, bottle gourd etc.). They have given seeds to 250 families, of which 148 families would be \nsupported till the end of the project. For the landless, they promote mushroom cultivation and goat rearing.        \n\u25cf They connect 18+ youth to skill development plans (vocational courses such as training in automobile repairs, as \nelectricians and on soft skills etc) and offer employment support as well.  \n\u25cf At present, they are training farmers directly on the field but in the next phase, they will start training partners as \nwell.  \n\u25cf They also connect families to social protection schemes for livelihoods like MGNREGA, PM Samman etc \n\u25cf They promote farmer interest groups. Working on financial literacy is also in our plan.    \nCurrent MIS \u25cf Since the last 6-7 months, they have been using an application called inbuilt for reporting and monitoring their work. \nThe application captures location of staff and enables them to share updates of the work done and real-time pictures \nfrom the field. They work according to their weekly plans.  \n\u25cf They have a small team but the team is proficient in using Kobo toolbox for monitoring. They have an MIS person \nwhose job is to verify the data sent via random field visits and official records.     \nMPR Feedback \u25cf Overall, they are happy with the format shared at the outcome level.  \n\u25cf Given that the MPR might not be relevant for them being a technical partner, but they wish to report the work that \nthey are doing with the survivors in the MPR.  \n\u25cf Would be better if we could report in a narrative format (along with the numbers) as it helps capture \nstories/pathways of progress.   \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf Indicators are largely self-explanatory; minimal amount of capacity building support required.   \n  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       35 \n \n3.2 BMVS \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf They work in 10 villages of Jale block of Darbhanga district.  \n\u25cf In education, they work on strengthening SMCs/ward level CPCs, youth groups of girls aged 6-14 and 14-18, \nrunning bridge courses for imparting basic literacy and life skills, making schools safe (by getting schools to have a \nchild protection policy in place), liasoning with education officials at block/district level, facilitate meeting between \nsuch officials and the community and running awareness campaigns for re-enrollment of dropouts, on social \nprotection schemes and livelihoods. Facilitation of enrollment is out of the scope of work of the organization.  \n\u25cf For child protection cases, issues are identified mainly through youth groups. Then these are referred to the CPC (by \nthe community mobiliser) post which the parents of the potential victim are spoken to/counseled. Youth groups \ncounsel the potential victims. The entire process takes up to a week. All actions are undertaken by the community \nwhile being facilitated by BMVS.   \n\u25cf The organisation stopped 12 cases of child marriage in the last 6 months.  \n\u25cf CPCs were reinstated by March 2024 and half of all CPCs have had meetings till now. About 8 SMC trainings have \nbeen conducted till now.    \n\u25cf They don\u2019t work much on survivor collectives or survivors in general.  \nCurrent MIS \u25cf Have a staff of 6 people for implementation and reporting.  \n\u25cf They had a quarterly reporting format for previous funders while they would collect data at an organizational level \nmonthly.  \n\u25cf Data is collected manually from the field, while a coordinator/MIS person compiles the same before reporting. Data \nis also verified through reports obtained from the community resource centers or schools.   \n\u25cf The MIS person works out of the field office in Jale and comes to Muzaffarpur once a week.  \nMPR Feedback \u25cf Difficult for the team to comprehend and use the MPR (was not able to locate the drop-down list on the cover page). \nThey\u2019ve used a google-form based reporting format before and it was easier for them to use it as compared to the \nMPR.  \n\u25cf Difficult to get data on dropouts, irregular attendance. No school will provide this information.  \n\u25cf In Bihar (and the areas that they work in), bridge courses are run by NGOs. Remedial classes were offered by school, \nbut they\u2019ve stopped for years now. Of the children attending bridge courses, only a few re-enroll in schools - the  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       36 \n \nindicators related to bridge courses need to change in the MPR to suit the context of Bihar.   \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf Require in-person training on MPR (especially for the MIS person). Did not find online training that useful.  \n\u25cf Require training on the MPR for the field team as well as they are the ones who will get the data.  \n\u25cf Need to understand the mechanisms for getting data and the means of verification required.  \n\u25cf Need clarifications of definitions of certain indicators like multi-stakeholders, reporting and prevention of cases etc. \nand understanding the interconnections between the indicators.   \n \n3.3 Tatvasi Samaj Nyas (TSN) \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf Started work in 2004 in 5 districts. Initially, their work focused on rescue and rehabilitation of survivors but now the \nfocus has shifted to child protection.  \n\u25cf Their work on rehabilitation (which includes linking the survivors to compensation packages, providing legal aid, \nfacilitating social protection schemes for families and re-enrolling in schools) will be slowly phased out by December.  \n\u25cf The geographical focus of the BAT project is on 30 wards in 10 villages of 5 panchayats in Azamnagar block of \nKatihar district in Bihar. All the areas chosen under the BAT project are new.    \n\u25cf They informed that of the 117 children rescued from Jaipur last year, about 87 were from Azamnagar block. They \nwere able to provide full compensation to 11 survivors last year. 2 child marriages were stopped recently.  \n\u25cf In education, their work involves strengthening SMCs/W-CPCs, monitoring and re-enrolling dropouts, and \nconducting bridge courses. They conduct enrollment drives, help children with applications, open bank accounts, and \nfollow up on them once the admissions are done.  \n\u25cf  In livelihoods, they mainly work on facilitating microloans through MFIs and Jeevika. SSEVS has trained and \nprovided vegetable seeds to the farmers in farming techniques, but the effort got wasted due to the flood situation \nin the area.    \n\u25cf They have formed and work with a survivor collective called Pragati for survivors of child labour. They work to build \nconfidence of the survivors so they can create awareness on the issue in the community, connect them with DLSA \nand DM and educate them on their rights and entitlements  \n\u25cf They\u2019ve formed community vigilance committees (CVCs) of people aged 18 to 45 (of which 50% are women) to  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       37 \n \nidentify traffickers. Youth and adolescent groups have also been formed.  \nCurrent MIS \u25cf Have a team of 6 people in Azamnagar block for project execution and management. Have 2 block coordinators and \n2 frontline workers for the 5 GPs.  \n\u25cf Data is collected by all people in the organization depending on the level of data collection. Both - the number of \nactivities conducted, and number of people reached are reported.  \n\u25cf Data collection is manual and then collated and entered in excel once a month. They have a \u2018Dainik Prativedan\u2019 form \nfor recording everyday\u2019 s work. A logbook is used for recording the field staff\u2019s travel. All staff work according to an \nindividual work plan prepared for a month.    \nMPR Feedback \u25cf TSN enrolls children under 6 years in their bridge courses and wants to report their numbers as well in the MPR.  \n\u25cf Schools used to provide remedial education, but this has stopped since 2016. The remedial education indicator might \nnot be relevant given this context.   \n\u25cf Very difficult to get data on dropouts, irregular attendance (schools will not share such data).   \n\u25cf Have not had a good experience with previous technical partners for MEL. Hence, expect the MPR and the entire \nreporting process to be as simple as possible now.  They\u2019ve also conducted rallies advocating for building \ninfrastructure for schools.  \n\u25cf Foresee challenges in evidence-based reporting for most indicators. Data will be collected but getting proof of \nauthenticity of the same might prove to be an issue. Some stakeholders will give information while some may not.   \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf Require a point-of-contact from the MEL team who they can take support from whenever required.  \n\u25cf Have a large understood the indicators but require sufficient training on the MPR in order to understand the \nlanguage clearly.   \n \n3.4 Adithi \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf Started in 1988 with a focus on working for women\u2019s issues and organizational development.  \n\u25cf Under BAT, they work in 2 blocks - Sonbarsa and Parihar - 10 panchayats, 25 villages and 75 wards.  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       38 \n \n\u25cf They work on child protection at the village, ward, GP, block and district levels. They work on capacity building of \npara-legal volunteers at the village level, CPCs, youth groups (meena manch, bal sansad) at ward level, PRI members \nand SMCs at GP level, B-CPC/police at the block level, and liasoning with DLSA at district level with the aim of \nmaking child protection committees functional and accountable. They work with the education department at the \nblock level to train and sensitize them to work on RTE issues and child-friendly policies. They also work to facilitate \nthe uptake of social protection schemes (e.g. connecting them with Jeevika for loans).  \n\u25cf Informers within the youth groups help them identify child protection cases.   \n\u25cf They have 2 community mobilisers to look after 5 villages each. \n\u25cf For dropouts, the ward-level groups identify them, the organization gets the children re-enrolled in schools, and \nmonitors them once the admission is done.  They run bridge courses for dropouts/ never enrolled and tuitions for \nclass 9/10 students (this work has only started since April 2024). They support the government in running \nenrollment campaigns. They also facilitate linkages to vocational courses (but only those run by the government). \n\u25cf They also have a survivor collective called \u2018Aagaz Sangathan\u2019.  \n\u25cf Under BAT, 80% of the villages chosen are new while in the remaining 20%, they\u2019ve been working since last year.    \n\u25cf They work collaboratively with SSEVS who has distributed vegetable seeds to selected families and has trained the \npartner staff and farmers on farming techniques. The organization requires a lot of support and handholding to work \non livelihoods.  \nCurrent MIS \u25cf They report their work done based on activities conducted - the number of training/activities done, and the number \nof people reached is what is reported.  \n\u25cf Data collection, monitoring and reporting is a collaborative process. While the community mobiliser collects data \nmanually from the field, the program coordinator validates it and then the data is sent to the program \nimplementation officer for her review before being sent to the funder. An MIS person (along with a program staff) is \navailable for digitizing the manually collected data.  \n\u25cf Previously, they have also developed and used monitoring formats for monitoring work done by SMCs.     \nMPR Feedback \u25cf The numbers asked for reporting are quite detailed. Require support to know which sources of information should \nbe considered (where will the data come from?) \n\u25cf Schools/block resource centers do not have data on dropouts. So, it is very difficult to get information on the \nindicators for dropouts/irregular attendance. SMCs might collect/monitor the status of dropouts, but it is difficult to \ncheck its authenticity. Would be better if they had a format for monitoring of SMCs.   \n\u25cf Very few schools ran remedial classes last summer but largely schools do not run any bridge or remedial education  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       39 \n \nclasses. Indicators pertaining to this issue need to be tweaked to align with the context of Bihar.  \n\u25cf Columns for remarks should be added for all indicators so they can share all the qualitative remarks along with the \nnumbers.      \n\u25cf Not clear what \u2018knowledge events\u2019 mean.  \n\u25cf For the indicator on training of stakeholders for education, Police/DLSA will not be applicable.  \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf Need support on better understanding the indicators. Language becomes a constraint in understanding indicator \ndefinitions.  \n\u25cf Require training support for the field staff as well as they are the ones collecting the data.  \n \n3.5 Centre Direct \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf Under the BAT project, CD works in 2 blocks namely Chandauti and Khizersarai of Gaya district. In Chanduati, they \nwork in 9 GPs, 15 villages and 45 wards whereas in Khizersarai, they work in 9 GPs, 10 villages and 30 wards.  \n\u25cf They work mainly on strengthening committees aimed at child protection such as youth, adolescent, children\u2019s \ngroups (formed by CD) and School management committees, and child protection committees at ward, GP, block and \ndistrict level (formed by the govt). \n\u25cf SSEVS works on livelihoods in their area. They\u2019ve provided seeds to farmers (farming on leased land) of 2 villages in \nChandauti block for growing vegetables. Another organization called Kheti has provided poly house and greenhouse \nsupport to farmers in their area.  \n\u25cf In 10 villages, they\u2019ve started 10 bridge course centers for dropouts, with each center catering to about 30 students. \nThe course - for children aged 6 to 14 years - runs for 6 months. Tutors record attendance of students and submit to \nthem monthly. On completion of the bridge course, interested students are linked to schools.   \n\u25cf Remedial classes have been newly introduced in Bihar.  \n\u25cf They also connect survivors to vocational training courses however they face challenges in doing so given that \nenrollment in vocational courses requires the candidates to have studied till class 8th.  \n\u25cf They work with Child welfare committees (at the district level). Child protection cases are reported to the CWC at \npresent as CPCs are not strengthened yet.   \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       40 \n \n\u25cf Due to CDs efforts, for the 1st time, about 15.5 lakhs were allotted for child protection in the GPDP budget of \ncertain villages in Gaya district. \n\u25cf Work also involves liasoning with officials working on child protection at the district level - this at times gets difficult \ndue to frequent transfer of government officials.  \nCurrent MIS \u25cf They have a total staff of 16 people.  \n\u25cf Field staff sends daily work updates on WhatsApp and on google forms. Once every month, a meeting is held at the \noffice to validate the work and the data. Actual work is tracked against the plan.   \n\u25cf About 8 panchayat facilitators collect data manually at the ward level and report the same to the block coordinator \nat the district level. Some data is collected directly by the block coordinator as well. Block coordinator reports data \nto the CD office at the district level.   \nMPR Feedback \u25cf Challenging to get data on number of dropouts or irregular students. Mostly, schools will not share such data.  \n\u25cf Would be helpful if they knew which sources of data can be used for collecting data for the MPR and the means of \nverification that can be used.   \n\u25cf Would be helpful if they got data compiled at a village-level (at least every 6 months).   \n\u25cf Full forms of abbreviations should be there (e.g. WASH) as it might be clear to everyone.  \n\u25cf On SMCs, the indicator should be school-level committees strengthened, and not created as these committees \nalready exist and they only work to strengthen them.  \n\u25cf Would have preferred to have activity-based reporting as our work is more visible then.  \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf Need support in understanding some indicators such as functional CPCs and frequency of reporting as data for many \nindicators won\u2019t change monthly.  \n \n4. Rajasthan:  \nRajasthan state has a unique context for the COF-KAWACH program, in comparison to the other three target states. The program has been \nimplemented in the urban context of Jaipur district. All partners are familiar with the geography since the same partners have been working for a  \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       41 \n \nlong period and continuing the work from the previous engagements. However, the approach towards child protection is shifting from rescue to \npreventive with resilience building as a focus area1.  \n \n4.1 Pardarshita \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf Pardarshita\u2019s larger focus has been on education and pedagogy to ensure improvement in learning outcomes.  \n\u25cf Currently, they are working across 22 wards and 8 areas through 8 Learning Resource Centers (LRCs) \n\u25cf They also work with CCP and engage with 50 SMCs to strengthen them. Strengthened SMC will ensure reduction in \ndropouts and support in identification of any child exploitation cases.  \n\u25cf Pardarshita engages with youth and children collectives (Child Parliament) for identification of potential dropouts \nand child protection issues.  \n\u25cf Through learning they provide a platform to bridge the learning gains and ensure new or re enrollment into \nappropriate school levels.  \n\u25cf To facilitate the enrollment and admissions, they also help with social protection entitlement related documents.  \n\u25cf They are also working with CCP for Safe school initiative in 9 schools out of 50 schools.  \nCurrent MIS \u25cf Pardarshita has an excel based MIS where they track their activities \n\u25cf Learning center admissions and school admissions get tracked at the individual level.  \n\u25cf Social entitlements are also getting tracked at the individual level. Details of social entitlements are not fully \ncaptured.  \n\u25cf However, these systems exist at the LRC level and MIS officers collate everything manually from all files at the \ncentral level.  \n\u25cf SMC gets tracked by 16 program officers operating across 8 areas/8 LRCs. These officers can track 16 SMC \nmeetings monthly; whereas the rest of the SMC gets tracked through pictures shared over WhatsApp through \nvolunteers or Children Groups.  \nMPR Feedback \u25cf The current version of the MPR helps in comprehensively capturing the program outcomes.  \n \n1 Partners like Taabar continue to engage in the same way   \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       42 \n \n\u25cf Identification of cases through NGO can be added as an option in the format since Pardarshita staff also identifies \nvarious child exploitation cases due to their close engagement with communities.  \n\u25cf SMC wise activities related to functional and operational can be captured - following the old format of MPR that \nthey used to report. That helps in managing the SMC strengthening well.  \n\u25cf Remarks columns for each indicator can be added since narrative for each outcome is also crucial. Numbers may not \nbe able to effectively demonstrate efforts being put in to achieve the outcomes.  \n\u25cf They also requested to understand the effectiveness and fidelity of the processes being implemented. They would \nwant to learn and understand which process has been the most effective.  \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf They do have dedicated resources for MIS and program activities. Hand Holding on the format will help them.  \n\u25cf Tools to capture activity level interactions and follow up the same institution/individual would help in making \nreporting smoother.  \n \n4.2 Access Development Services \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf Under the COF-KAWACH project, Access continues to work with 60 SHGs and around 850 women members to \nprovide employment through Producer Company (PC). They are using economic empowerment as a lever for \nresilience building.  \n\u25cf Access\u2019s larger focus has been building capacities of women through life skills and business skills training to ensure \nthat they are able to participate in the value chain activities for crafts. They facilitate training and exposure sessions \nfor producer company members to understand the market and engage with customers.  \n\u25cf Access provides access to various social security entitlements to women members; supporting in preparing relevant \ndocuments and also renewing some of the old entitlements as well.  \n\u25cf Access links PC women to banks as well to facilitate micro loans and seed money (non-returnable) from NULM.  \n\u25cf Access ensures that children of SHG and producer company women dont engage into child labour and also attend \nschools regularly. Access conducts random visits to member houses to monitor and report the same.  \nCurrent MIS \u25cf Access has a robust monitoring system that tracks all activities across the program.   \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       43 \n \n\u25cf They are tracking all SHGs and provide management support. Availability of funds, minutes of meetings and \nfunctioning of SHGs are ensured through regular monitoring.  \n\u25cf They also track employment and wages for each PC member regularly.  \n\u25cf Training sessions and attendance of women gets tracked at the individual level.  \n\u25cf Social protection for women members gets tracked at the individual level.  \n\u25cf Currently, Access does not track or report the educational status of SHG women\u2019s children that they monitor \nthrough random spot visits.  \nMPR Feedback \u25cf The shared MPR format is more intuitive and helps us understand what needs to be captured.  \n\u25cf The current format of the MPR does not capture business aspects of the Producer company comprehensively.  \n\u25cf They would want to see the progress against the target set out in the LFA that is agreed with BAT more seamlessly \nthrough a technology tool.  \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf The Access team is competent and aware of current MIS tools and programs thoroughly.  \n\u25cf The capacity building will focus on training on the activity-based MIS and ensuring that all activities get captured. \n \n \n4.3 SEWA \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf SEWA has been operating in Rajasthan state across multiple clusters for over a decade. Operations in Jaipur are also \na little over 4-5 years old and they are working with 75 SHGs; of which 69 SHGs are active currently.  \n\u25cf SEWA largely focuses on empowering women by imparting life skills in women and helping them engage into value \ngeneration activities. Their focus is on women empowerment through capacity building and not business activities.  \n\u25cf SEWA monitors the functioning of SHGs regularly and provides support whenever necessary.  \n\u25cf Their focus is also on financial literacy programs and linking SHG women to banks. In the process, they also facilitate \nsocial protection schemes for these women members.  \n\u25cf They also support SHG women\u2019s children for education through learning centers to bridge the gap for new or re-\nenrollment.   \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       44 \n \nCurrent MIS \u25cf SEWA has been working with SHGs for quite some time and the systems put in place are rudimentary in nature.  \n\u25cf All data related to education (enrollment/admission, learning center) gets tracked at the individual level \n\u25cf Social protection data formats are basic and need further nuance. Currently, they capture only member names and \ndocuments. Scheme names etc. are not being captured.  \n\u25cf Like Access, training sessions and attendance of women gets tracked at the individual level.  \nMPR Feedback \u25cf The current MPR format helps them understand the processes and what is expected for reporting.  \n\u25cf All fields are not applicable for SEWA, and they would want to capture more activities to showcase the efforts being \nput in.  \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf The training will be required to build perspectives on the value of comprehensive MIS systems capturing activities.  \n\u25cf The staff of SEWA is not well versed with technology tools, and they may require more intensive hand holding.  \n \n \n4.4 LEDS \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf LEDS\u2019s work focuses on the migrant population and single women. They work with them to provide social \nentitlements and education to their children.  \n\u25cf They provide bridge learning through 5 LRCs and work with 9 schools in 2 areas.  \n\u25cf They provide courses and entitlements support for pre-schooling age of 3-6 years to enable enrollment into \nschools.   \n\u25cf They form a child parliament and action research group composed of fellows that help in identification of child \nexploitation issues and dropouts.  \n\u25cf LEDS will be phasing out of the program from next year.  \nCurrent MIS \u25cf The MIS is very basic, and it captures the data at the LRC level for attendance.  \n\u25cf LRC also has details on enrollment/admission for dropouts of children. \n\u25cf Social entitlements of the individual get tracked at the aggregated level.   \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       45 \n \nMPR Feedback \u25cf The language of the MPR is not clear; having MPR in Hindi would be beneficial.  \n\u25cf Certain output reporting can be arranged in alignment with the themes. Suggested to shift convergence activities \nfrom 'Livelihoods' tab to 'Groups' tab.  \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf LEDS will require a deep handholding for activity-based MIS, since they are used to track aggregated output \nnumbers.  \n\u25cf The training will be required to build perspectives on the value of comprehensive MIS systems capturing activities.  \n\u25cf The staff of LEDS is not well versed with technology tools and they may require more intensive hand holding.  \n \n4.5 Centre for Child Protection (CCP) \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf Center for Child Protection is a government-aided institution working mainly on system strengthening work.  \n\u25cf They work with the government departments to release various directives focusing on resource allocations for SMC \nstrengthening, formation of CPCs, and conducting convergence activities \n\u25cf They provide support to other program partners in engaging with the government (Pardarshita for SMC \nstrengthening, safe school initiatives etc.; LEDS for admissions in primary schools).  \n\u25cf They also conduct capacity building sessions to share the best practices, orient them on various child protection \nrelated laws and help in framing right articles and sections for each child protection case.  \nCurrent MIS \u25cf CCP has a robust MIS system to capture all activities. All capacity building sessions are captured for attendance  \n\u25cf They also maintain a case management for all children and work with CWC  \n\u25cf Their counseling sessions are also getting tracked for participation \nMPR Feedback \u25cf The MPR format doesn't capture their efforts at all since the work is very focused on system strengthening which \nhas a higher gestation period for outcome realisation.  \n\u25cf BAT will share a separate format for technical partners. \n\u25cf A format that tracks activities need to be captured for each engagement and liasoning with the government.   \n \n \n \nCatalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd. (https://cms.org.in/)       46 \n \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf Capacity building would be needed to ensure uptake of the tech-based tool in the future.  \n \n4.6 Taabar \nTheme Narrative \nProgram \nActivities \n\u25cf Taabar engages in providing post rescue support for reintegration of boys and children.  \n\u25cf This is provided in batches to ensure full comprehensive support starting from medical checkups, dealing with the \ngovernment for FIR and other legal support, nutritional support, counseling etc.  \n\u25cf Support for 1 batch lasts for 4-5 months. And they run 2 batches- each of 40-50 at any point in time.   \n\u25cf They also build capacities for the government departments- labour departments, CWCs and DCPUs.  \nCurrent MIS \u25cf Currently, Taabar manages their operations through a batch register and ensures case management of each child.  \n\u25cf They also capture details on the capacity building of the government departments. \nMPR Feedback \u25cf The MPR format doesn't capture their efforts since the work is very focused on the case management and provides \nall relevant support. \n\u25cf BAT will share a separate format for technical partners. \n\u25cf A format that tracks activities needs to be captured for each follow up and track status changes over time.  \nCapacity \nbuilding \n\u25cf Training for Taabar would be on the case management tool or the MIS to be set up. However, a minimum effort will \nbe required since they already have a case management tool and are well versed with it.  \n ", "BAT KAWACH MEL - Inception Report.pdf": "InceptionReport\nKAWACH-MonitoringEvaluationandLearning(MEL)\nJune2024CatalystManagementServicesPrivateLimitedSubmittedto:BritishAsianTrust\nContactPerson:\nPrerakShah,EvidenceforChange,CMS\nprerak@catalysts.orgTableofContents\nTableofContents 2Listofabbreviations 31.Abouttheprogram 52.ObjectivesandScopeofwork 62.1ObjectivesoftheProgram 62.2ObjectivesoftheMELsystem 62.3ScopeoftheMELsystem 63.TechnicalApproach 83.1MonitoringandEvaluationApproach 83.1.1TheoryofChange 83.1.2CascadetoImpactIndicators 83.1.3Learningfromthelandscaping\ufb01eldvisits 93.1.4DevelopmentofastandardMIS 123.1.5Qualityassurancemechanism 163.1.6Establishingconcurrentlearningsynthesismechanism 173.1.7Outputs 203.2LearningFramework 213.2.1Mainlearningquestions 213.3CapacitybuildingschedulefortheNGOpartners 223.4HighLevelworkplanandMilestones 234.Annexure 25\nCatalystManagementServicesPvt.Ltd.

However, implementing a comprehensive and accessible children\u2019s protection system is riddled \nwith a myriad of challenges. The key challenge is the very nature of child protection violations, often shrouded in \nstigma and hidden from public view.\nBritish Asia Trust (BAT) is committed to keeping children safe from all forms of violence, abuse, and exploitation. \nWith an ambitious vision to achieve a 30% reduction in child labour, child trafficking, child marriage, and commercial \nsexual exploitation of children, as well as a 50% reduction in online child sexual abuse and exploitation, specifically \nin the states where these crimes against children are most prevalent, BAT has launched the KAWACH programs \n(Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Rajasthan). The program seeks to transform the child protection system \nin the country by constructing a comprehensive prevention model to establish a secure ecosystem, mitigate \nvulnerabilities, and bolster the prosecution of traffickers and exploiters. This pioneering model of prevention and \nprotection strategies will honour the need to nurture the child protection ecosystem through data, evidence, and \nmulti-stakeholder collaboration to prevent online abuse, exploitation, and emerging threats that endanger children. \nTo provide the foundational data and set pre intervention benchmark for key indicators, Athena Infonomics carried \nout the Baseline Study in these 5 States covering 16 focused Districts. The study aims to gain a deep understanding \nof the scope and breadth of the protection concerns of children, including the prevalence, knowledge, attitudes, \nand factors that affect child tye key protection issues in the country. It also recognizes children as an active agent \nwith rights and explores children\u2019s agency and decision-making capacity on child protection issues. Generating \ngood data is crucial to promoting evidence-informed programming that tells us what the issues are, where they \nare and how best to tackle them. \nThe research process was crucial to identify and build relationships with stakeholders, including community \nstakeholders, judicial representatives, government agencies, caregivers and children at all levels, so that these \nconcerns are addressed systematically, and a coalition is built to support the strategies identified. This baseline \nstudy also provides an overview of the institutional challenges, including gaps in legal frameworks, and capacity \ngaps in support provided by the government, NGOs, and community institutions such as the Gram Panchayats, \nSchool Management Committees, and the Village Child Protection Committees.\nA number of recommendations for addressing the issues are highlighted by the research. I am optimistic that in \nour effort to formulate interventions, these findings will be utilized effectively to guide the implementation of \nprograms. This is an urgent matter for us in the BAT\u2013 to create a safer environment for our children. It is critical \nthat together, we ensure the protection of our children by strengthening prevention strategies, supporting \neffective implementation of the laws and policies that protect them.  \nThis report is just a beginning. We hope that the momentum generated through this report and the Kwach \ninitiative will continue to build a strong child protection ecosystem in India. \n-British Asian Trust\nFOREWORD\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nBASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 5\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nThis baseline report is a result of seven months of consultative and collaborative process, rooted in a robust \nmethodology supported by rigorous methods and techniques throughout the data collection and analysis process.\nThe baseline evaluation required the coordinated efforts of many people.

According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the \nincidence of crimes against children surged from 28.9 per lakh children in 2020 to 33.6 in 2021.1 \n\u2022 NCRB findings indicate a 20% increase in cases of child trafficking and exploitation, along with a 16% rise in \nsexual abuse or crimes against children in the preceding year. With developments in technology children have \nbecome vulnerable to abuse through digital mediums. A global survey, 54 per cent of the young population \nreported having experienced online sexual harm before they were 18 years old.2 \n\u2022 The British Asian Trust has introduced the KAWACH initiative, targeting a substantial reduction in child labor, \ntrafficking, marriage, and online abuse over the next decade in specific high-prevalence states. \n\u2022 To gauge the current child protection landscape, this baseline study was carried out to assess prevalence, \nvulnerabilities, and stakeholder knowledge at the district level, establishing baseline values for monitoring \nprogress and identifying crucial stakeholders in the fight against child exploitation. \n\u2022 The study covered 5 issues focused by the KAWACH initiatives: Child Marriage, Child Labor, Child Trafficking, \nChild Sexual Abuse (CSA), and Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (OCSAE).\n\u2022 The study covered a survey sample of 6560 mothers and 6560 children (aged 13-18 years) from 160 villages \nequal distributed between 16 districts of the 4 focused states: West Bengal, Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar \nPradesh. In addition, 164 qualitative interactions were done with key stakeholders from government and \ncommunity representatives. \n\u2022 Given the hidden nature of these issues, Network Scale-Up Method (N-SUM) was used for measuring the prevalence.3 \n\u2022 The findings show 13.9% of mothers have witnessed at least one incident of child marriage, with Murshidabad \ndistrict in West Bengal reporting the highest incidence at 66.2%. Based on N-SUM estimates, the average \nrate of child marriage per district was estimated at 19.4%, with Darbanga having the highest rate at 35.6%. \n\u2022 2.6% of mothers have witnessed at least one incident of child labor, with Murshidabad district in West Bengal \nreporting the highest incidence at 20.2%. While more than 20% of the children were working in family settings/\nhousehold settings across. Incident of child labor was faced primarily by boys with average prevalence for \nboys was 18% as compared to 0.9% for girls.\n\u2022  Among the 160 villages surveyed, 91 reported witnessing at least one case of child marriage and 38 villages \nreported witnessing at least one case of child labor.\n\u2022 Reasons cited for early marriage include the fear of eloping or engaging in an affair at a young age. While child \nlabor was attributed to poverty and economic struggle. \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n1. NCRB Crime in India Report 2021, https://ncrb.gov.in/en/Crime-in-India-2021\n2.

Similarly, children showed comprehensive \nunderstanding of the detrimental effects of child labor during qualitative interactions but underscore a \nthorough understanding on the significance of reporting child labor. \n\u2022 Overall reporting on witnessing issues of trafficking, sexual abuse, and online child sexual abuse & exploitation \n(OCSAE) was very low. \n\u2022 Some of the potential reasons for low reporting of these issues include poor understand of the issues and its \nidentification, fear and shame associated with the issue, legal formalities associated, cultural norms and practices etc. \n\u2022 Qualitative findings report challenges in identifying victims and the hidden nature of the problem makes it \ndifficult to gain an accurate picture of the trends and prevalence of child trafficking.\n\u2022  It was also revealed that trafficking is often confused as child labor, making the issue hard to recognize. \nKnowledge related to child trafficking was also low among children with only 40.7% reported receiving any \ninformation on child trafficking. \n\u2022 Qualitative findings indicated children getting confused between child labor and trafficking. Illiteracy, poverty, \nand unemployment were reported as the main factors for child trafficking though some variation in factors \nemerged across states. \n\u2022 In case of sexual abuse, contradicting picture on the prevalence of child sexual abuse, whether the cases are \nincreasing or decreasing, emerged. Some reported drastic increase in sexual abuse cases while others stated \nthat this is only due to improvement in reporting of cases. Overall, this indicated the sensitively involved in \ndiscussing sexual abuse.\n\u2022 Mothers showed relatively better knowledge on sexual abuse as compared to children, but both showed need \nfor improvement. \n\u2022 For child online sexual abuse and exploitation, low reporting was hindered by low knowledge of the mother. \nWhile other stakeholders (government officials and NGOs) acknowledge the issue of OCSEA. \n\u2022 Majority of the children had access to smart phones but less the half of them (46%) reported their parent \nsupervising their activities. Lack of parent supervision was reported as one of the key factors leading to \nmisuse of social media, pornography addiction, etc. Similarly, only 55% of mothers reported willingness to \nreport a case of OCSEA. \n\u2022 Overall, the study captured prevalence of 5 key child protection issues and highlights the key indicators to be \nfocused by future intervention. It also captures prevalence of associated themes like school enrolment, mental \nhealth of children, agency of children, economic vulnerabilities of families, parental support practices etc.\n\u2022 The findings indicate need for a comprehensive and collaborative approach to child protection. Future \nintervention should actively engage individuals, communities, educational institutions, and policymakers \nfor an effective and sustainable intervention. Furthermore, the findings call out for urgent need in shifting \nsocietal beliefs, norms, and practices to combat stigma, creating a protective environment for children.1\nINTRODUCTIONBASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 17\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\n1.1 Background and Context of the KAWACH Program \nChild protection has emerged as a crucial priority across the world, especially in India. The rate of crimes against \nchildren in the country increased from 28.9 per lakh children in 2020 to 33.6 in 2021 (National Crime Records \nBureau 2022)4. In consideration of the prevailing child protection issues in India, the British Asian Trust (BAT) \nand Children\u2019s Investment Foundation Fund (CIFF) have commissioned the KAWACH program, to construct \na comprehensive prevention model to establish a secure ecosystem, mitigate vulnerabilities, and bolster the \nprosecution of traffickers and exploiters.  \nOf the many child protection issues that are prevalent in the country, the KAWACH program focuses on 5 major \nones-\nChild Marriage - It is one of the oldest and most pressing child protection issues. According to a report by UNICEF \nin 20235, India has the highest number of girls and women who were married during their childhood. Uttar \nPradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh collectively account for more than half of these \ncases in the country. \nChild Labor \u2013The prevalence of child labor persists due to factors like poverty, lack of access to education, and \nsocial norms. As per Census 20116, the number of working children in the age group of 5-14 years is 43.53 lakh. \nIn our country, over half of the total child labour population works in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya \nPradesh, and Maharashtra7. \nChild Trafficking \u2013 According to the ILO\u2019s 2005 Global Report, Asia 8 has the highest number of child trafficking \nvictims. In India, West Bengal, particularly along the borders of Bangladesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra \nwitness significant cases of child labour. In addition to this. Jharkhand and Bihar, marked by poverty and limited \neducational opportunities, are source areas for child trafficking in the country.  \nChild sexual abuse  - Child sexual abuse in India affects children across various age groups, socioeconomic \nbackgrounds, and geographical locations9. The NCRB report highlights a 16.2% increase in crime against children \nin 2021 compared to the previous year. Cultural norms and limited access to education has led to massive \nunderreporting of these cases.\n1. INTRODUCTION\n4. NCRB Crime in India Report 2021, https://ncrb.gov.in/en/Crime-in-India-2021\n5.

Acts such as the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act (2015), the Protection of Children from \nSexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (2006) have proven effective in reducing \noffenses against children. In addition to legal measures, the government has established the National Commission for \nProtection of Child Rights (NCPCR) as a statutory body to oversee the enforcement of laws and ensure the protection \nof children\u2019s rights. Complementing these efforts, various schemes such as Integrated Child Protection Scheme, Sarva \nShiksha Abhiyan, National Child Labour Project Scheme and Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Abhiyan have been introduced \nto promote and uphold child rights. The efforts of both the National and State Government is reflected in their budget \nallocation for various child protection effort. In last decade, the union budget has seen significant reduction towardas \nfunds allocated to children. In 2022-23 the budget for children stood at 2.35% of union budget which is significant \ndrop from 4.76%.12 The tables below shows that allocation to children has consistently reduced each year, over the \nlast decade.  The table below provides a snapshot budgetary allocation on various scheme in recent years. \nDespite the establishment of various laws and policies by the government to safeguard children, the successful \nimplementation of these measures remains a challenge. Inadequate enforcement mechanisms result in \nprotection loopholes, particularly in areas such as combating trafficking, enforcing child labour regulations, and \nrehabilitating rescued children. There is a pressing need for improvement in these aspects. Additionally, the lack \nof awareness among communities and parents regarding child rights and protective measures leads to children \nbeing more vulnerable to such incidents. The increased use of digital platforms poses an emerging threat, making \nit necessary to take measures to protect children from online exploitation and cyberbullying. It has become \ncrucial to incorporate strategies for digital literacy and online safety into child protection initiatives. Effectively \n12.

Thus, the first task of a proper NSUM estimation should be to conceptualize what it means to know \nsomeone in the context of the data collection. 17 That is, one must inform the respondent what constitutes \n\u201cknowing\u201d an individual in the context of the data collection. \n\u2022 When considering known population questions, it is imperative that sufficient data sources are available  to \ninform the research about the actual prevalence of these known population questions. That is what makes \nthese \u201cknown\u201d population subgroups. To estimate networks, statistics about the known population must be \navailable at the same geographical level (e.g., city, prefecture, region, or country) as the hidden population \nfor which prevalence estimation is sought. (Please refer to Annexure 11, for an example outlining the detailed \nsteps undertaken and the calculation done for calculation N-SUM prevalence.) \nData Collection\n\u2022 Collecting NSUM indicators ideally involves conducting household surveys clustered by each geographic \nregion of interest. Household survey techniques rely on random sampling methods, which is imperative \nfor generating a representative sample. By clustering random sampling by region, separate representative \nsamples can be produced for each region of interest. If a proper random sample is not achieved, then NSUM \nestimates become biased as the networks of the respondents do not necessarily resemble the networks of \nthe population. \nThe next page outlines the steps undertaken in this study to undertake the data collection and analysis \nusing the Network-Scale-Up method. For this study, the definition of someone in your network/knowing \nsomeone was defined as done in a study by UNAIDS on estimating the prevalence of HIV (UNAIDS) 18  \n(Outlined in the steps below)\n15.

Because of this, NSUM only produces aggregated \nestimates of the hidden population and does not reliably provide characteristic information on the hidden \npopulation beyond simple demographics. \n\u2022 NSUM also requires extensive existing data infrastructure, as census estimates of known sub-populations \nmust be obtained in advance of data collection. \n\u2022 Finally, NSUM contains three major biases that must either be addressed or accounted for when calculating \nprevalence estimates. \nTable 2.1.1: Biases of N-SUM, and the mitigation techniques\nBias Definition Mitigation technique\n1.  Transmission \nBias\nTransmission bias occurs when a respondent \nfails to recognize that they know something \nabout their friends and acquaintances (Yang \nand Yang 2017)19. Not knowing facts about \npeople in the network because those people do \nnot communicate that  information or because \nthe information is not readily observable is a \ntransmission problem (Kadushin, Kilworth, \nBernard, and Beveridge, 200620. \n\u2022  Mothers are more involved in their children\u2019s \nlives, which provides them with valuable \ninsights into their children\u2019s experiences, \nneeds, and vulnerabilities.\n\u2022  Additionally, women tend to be more \ninvolved in community affairs, engage in \nsocial interactions, and have networks of \nrelationships with neighbors and community \nmembers. \n2. Barrier Bias Barrier bias describes the various physical \nand social barriers that can prevent knowing \npeople in various populations (Maltiel, Raftery, \nMcCormick, and Baraff 2016)21. Barrier bias \noccurs from the non-random mixing of people \nin a society. In this way, knowing people is \noften influenced by a person\u2019s context and \ncharacteristics.\n\u2022  Utilizing random sampling is a strategy to \nmitigate barrier bias. Hence, a systematic \nrandom sampling method was employed \nfor the baseline survey to ensure a fair and \nunbiased selection process.\n3. Recall Bias Recall bias occurs when the respondent does \nnot accurately recall the number of people that \nthey know in the subpopulations that we ask \nthem about22 23.\n\u2022  It was clearly defined what it means to \u201cknow\u201d \nsomeone in the context of the survey. \n\u2022  Several known population questions were \nasked to exercise respondents\u2019 memory before \ndwelling on questions on hidden population. \n\u2022  Intensive training of field team \n19.

This led to challenges in \nconducting FGDs in the state. \n\u2022 Non-response from primary and \nsecondary list of stakeholders - As the \nstudy involved sensitive child protection \nissues, stakeholders were hesitant to be \na part of the interview which led to non-\nresponse. In some instances, government \nstakeholders demanded a letter of \npermission from authoritative sources.\n\u2022 Multiple rescheduling of interviews was \nrequested by government stakeholders \nsuch as the DLSAs and the DoW&CD, \ngiven their busy schedules. Due to this, \nthe team had to spend longer time on \nthe field than anticipated. \n\u2022 As the children were in schools during \nweekdays, it was challenging for the field \nteam to find them in households during \nthe daytime. This led to instances where \nthe field team could not interview the \nmother and child in a household at a given \ntime and had to revisit such households \nlater in the evening/ time suggested \nby the mother to interview the child. \nThis resulted in increased footwork for \nenumerators which affected the overall \nefficiency of the team and hence the \ndata collection timelines. \n\u2022 There were additional challenges faced \nby the field team to complete the sample \nfor male children. Field observations \nsuggested that it was difficult to find male \nchildren of the age group 13-18 years in \ntheir homes, in the evening as well. They \nwere either playing outside/ meeting \nfriends or engaged in some chores. \n\u2022 Observations from the field pointed \ntowards the underreporting of child \nprotection issues by mothers. Few \ninstances were observed by the \nenumerators where the child in the house \nwas married or engaged in employment \nactivity and the mother was not willing \nto report any child marriage or child \nlabor instance during the survey.\n\u2022 Despite enumerators clearly outlining \nthe confidentiality and privacy aspect \nof the consent, they observed hesitancy \nfrom respondents during the survey. This \nwas more prevalent during the Network \nScale-Up section of the mother\u2019s survey. \nChallenges during Qualitative  \ndata collection\nChallenges during Quantitative  \ndata collection3\nFINDINGSBASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 33\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\n3.1 Demographic details \nThe baseline evaluation used a mixed method approach which employs a comprehensive mix of quantitative and \nqualitative methodologies. \n3.1.1 Respondent Profile- Children and Mothers\nAge and Gender distribution of the surveyed children:  \n3.

In Kapasdanga village in Murshidabad, the mother reported \nto know the highest number of child marriage cases of girls (17 cases). Chandauli district from Uttar Pradesh had \nonly one mother who reported knowing 12 boys and 15 girls who got married before the age of 18 years. The \nmother belonged to Marui village in Chandauli.\nThe highest number of child marriage cases were estimated for the districts of West Bengal. However, the highest \nprevalence rate of child marriage was estimated in Bihar.\nThe highest number of child marriage cases were estimated in Darbhanga (Girls 3,10,964; Boys 2,71,826) and \nMurshidabad (Girls 2,54,753; Boys 1,05,081). Whereas the highest prevalence of child marriage was estimated \nfrom Darbhanga (Girls 35.6%; Boys 27 .9%), Katihar (Girls 26.6%; Boys 11%); and Gaya (Girls 24%; Boys 15.9%) \n(Refer to table 3.2.3). \nData from the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5 26) indicates that the prevalence of child marriage in \nIndia is 27% (rural) for girls and 21.1% (rural) for boys. In Darbhanga (35.6%) and Katihar (26.6%), the prevalence \nrate of child marriage among girls was estimated to be close to the national average. \nThe diversity of perspectives within the same state on the prevalence of child marriage underscores the complex \nand varied nature of the issue, influenced by regional factors, cultural practices, and levels of awareness and \neducation.\nInterviews with NGOs workers and other stakeholders present mixed opinions regarding the prevalence of \nchild marriage in the states. While respondents in UP and Bihar reported decreasing trends in the prevalence of \nchild marriage on account of increased awareness regarding the consequence of child marriage, respondents \nin West Bengal reported that there has been an increase in child marriage in the states. \nWe observed an intra-state variation in the perspectives of respondents concerning the prevalence of child \nmarriage. For instance, stakeholders in Bamer expressed concerns about child marriage being a significant issue, \nattributing it to prevalent cultural practices. In contrast, stakeholders in Jaipur believed that child marriage was \non the decline due to increased urbanization, heightened awareness, and a higher level of education.\nSimilarly, in Uttar Pradesh (UP), there were conflicting reports among stakeholders. Some indicated a \ndecline in child marriage cases, while others highlighted its persistence in specific locations such as Harraiya, \nSatdharwa, Tulsipur, Ghaisdi, Pachpedwa, and the Tharu belt. \n25.

However, it\u2019s important to note the \nmethodological difference between how the prevalence rates are calculated in this report, and in NFHS. \nLimitation in NSUM estimate for lower response rates-  N-SUM, methodologically, calculates the prevalence \nestimates using the census population of the subgroup in question (children aged 18 years and below, in the case \nof this study) While doing so, it does not account for the low response rate\n\u201c\nThe situation of child marriage in **** district is very bad, most of the cases are of child marriage which we are not \nable to stop. The child marriage is highest among Jat and Vishnoi castes. Recently there was report of 50 child \nmarriages have taken place in a single pandal. The existing practice of marrying children during any gathering such \nas funeral service in a family in the village as that reduces the cost of marriage has led to increased prevalence on \nchild marriage. \u2013 Government Stakeholder, West Bengal\nTable 3.2.3: Prevalence rates and numbers of Child Marriage using NSUM (N=903)\nState District Total  \nBoys (N)\nTotal  \nGirls (N) N\nPrevalence \nrate of boys \n(%)\nTotal child \nmarriage \ncases of \nboys (N)\nPrevalence \nrate of girls \n(%)\nTotal child \nmarriage \ncases of \ngirls(N)\nBihar Darbhanga 976012 873391 14 27.9 271826 35.6 310964\nBihar Gaya 1005066 943057 96 15.9 160217 24 225959\nBihar Katihar 796544 736648 149 11 87736 26.6 195665\nRajasthan Dungarpur 332146 311020 75 7. 8 25898 10.2 31576\nRajasthan Barmer 721640 634695 18 6.7 48581 12.6 79689\nUttar Pradesh Balrampur 548853 502730 44 13.9 764 01 24.2 121672\nUttar Pradesh Bareilly 805120 712790 60 3.7 29491 10.5 7514 8\nWest Bengal Jalpaiguri 57663 0 555516 22 9.2 52791 14.8 82150\nWest Bengal Murshidabad 1287912 1224145 270 8.2 105081 20.8 254753\nWest Bengal 24 Parganas \nNorth 813838 7 78518 119 6.2 50647 15.3 118877\nWest Bengal Darjeeling 216484 208816 22 2.6 5599 3.4 7111\nWest Bengal 24 Parganas \nNorth 119 1 2\n24 \nParganas \nNorth\n119 1 2\nWest Bengal Jalpaiguri 22 1 1 Jalpaiguri 22 1 1\nWest Bengal Darjeeling 22 0.4 0.5 Darjeeling 22 0.4 0.5\nAverage 903 9.38 85498 19.4 17195846 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\n3.2.2 Knowledge related to child marriage among mothers and children \nA very small proportion of respondents reported the legal age to be less than 18 years (0.5% mothers; 1.3% \nchildren) and 21 years (7% mothers; 10.3% children) for girls and boys respectively.\nAlmost all the mothers (98.4%; refer to table 3.2.4) reported the legal age of marriage to be 18 years or above \nacross all 16 sampled districts. 67 .4% reported the correct response of 18 years as the legal age of marriage for \ngirls.

The highest proportion of mothers who \nreported counseling other parents were from Jaipur (Rajasthan) (70%) and report to concerned authorities were \nfrom Jalpaiguri (West Bengal)  (37 .5%).\nIt is also observed that about 1/3rd of the mothers reported that they will not do anything, in case they witness \na case of child marriage in the community (29.3%) or will support it (4.5%). (Refer to table  A.3.4 in Annexure 3)\nIt was observed that a rather higher proportion (72.9%) of children reported that they would seek support \nor report the case to an authority if they found any friend or relative getting married before the legal age of \nmarriage. The highest proportions were reported from all 4 districts of West Bengal (97%-99%). The proportion \nof responses of children regarding seeking help or reporting child marriage remained low for Chandauli (UP) \n(43.9%), Bharatpur (Rajasthan) (42.9%), and Dungarpur (Rajasthan) (42.4%).

The highest \nproportion of mothers from Murshidabad (West Bengal) (78.5%) reported incidence of child marriage. This was \nfollowed by Katihar (Bihar) (39.8%) and North Parganas (West Bengal) (37 .1%). (Refer to table A.3.9 in Annexure 3). \nThe lowest proportions of incidence of child marriage were reported in UP- Bharatpur (2.9%) and Chandauli (3.7%). \nMurshidabad district in West Bengal had the highest proportion of children who married at a young age - self-\nreported child marriage (4.4%) and early marriage among friends and relatives (28.8%).\nOf all the children surveyed (N=6560) across 16 districts, only 0.4% were reported to be currently married.

The \nhighest proportion of mothers reporting a child labor incidence was observed from West Bengal- Murshidabad \n(20.2%), followed by North Parganas (5.8%) (Refer to table 3.3.1).\nMothers from various districts reported no cases of child labor- Bareilly, Prayagraj, Chandauli, Bharatpur, Barmer, \nJaipur, Darjeeling, and Sitamarhi.\nThe 167 mothers (2.6%) who reported that they knew at least one case of child labor, were spread across only \n38 villages (Refer to table A.24 in Annexure 4). Therefore, out of the total 160 villages where the survey was \nconducted, 122 villages had no reporting of any child labor case.\nOn average a mother reported knowing more than 2 boys who were victims of child labor. \nOn average, a mother knew 2.5 cases of boys who were victims of child labor. Mothers from Murshidabad reported \nthe highest average cases of boys who they knew were victims of child labor (3 cases) (Refer to table 3.3.2).\nThe maximum number of child labor cases amongst boys was reported from Khandail village in Gaya, Bihar- a \nmother reported to know 10 boys who were victims of child labor. While the cases of child labor among girls were \nconsiderably lower as opposed to boys, a mother from Palmathu Gamra from Dungarpur, Rajasthan reported to \nknow 5 cases of girls who were victim of child labor. (Refer to Annexure 4 for the list of villages)\nQualitative findings suggest a significant level of underreporting of child labor cases in the community. One of \nthe reasons highlighted during the qualitative interactions was how child labor cases are generally concealed \nwithin family assistance roles. \u201cChild labor is on the rise, often concealed within family assistance roles, making it \nchallenging to address effectively.\u201d \u2013 Government Stakeholder, Bihar.\nTable 3.3.2: Average number of child labor cases mothers know in their district (N=167)\nState Districts N Boys Girls\nBihar Darbhanga 6 2 1\nBihar Gaya 18 2 0.3\nBihar Katihar 5 2 0\nRajasthan Dungarpur 17 2 0.5\nUttar Pradesh Balrampur 1 2 1\nWest Bengal Murshidabad 83 3 0.01\nWest Bengal 24 Parganas North 24 2 0.04\nWest Bengal Jalpaiguri 12 0.5 0\nAverage 167 2.5 0.11BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 57\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nThe qualitative findings capture mixed response on the prevalence of child labor. Stakeholders in West Bengal and \nBihar acknowledges it as a prevalent issue reporting an increase, particularly in concealed family roles.  In contrast, \nstakeholders in Rajasthan suggests a decrease due to stringent state measures against child labor. According to NGO \npersonnel, \u201cRajasthan is the first state in India in which life imprisonment has been imposed in cases of child labor \nand trafficking.\u201d\nIn Uttar Pradesh, conflicting reports on numbers exist, with concerns about unreported cases. A CWC official \ncited underreporting due to a lack of shelter facilities, while another stated stable numbers. Yet, one highlighted a \ndecrease attributed to heightened awareness. DCPU authorities reported similar issues. DCPU authorities \nechoed similar concerns, and NGO personnel emphasized the challenge of obtaining authentic data on child \nlabor. Despite uncertainties about trends, some NGO personnel described the situation as dire, citing recent \nrescues in hotels and dhabas.\nBoth girls and boys in the state conveyed the persistence of the problem, noting instances of child labor in \nfields and brick kilns. Some members of CPC in the state also perceived an increase. However, in contrast, \nsome SMC members felt the issue is decreasing due to their active involvement. Some GP members also \nbelieved the problem is not prevalent. One GP member emphasized, \u201c In our panchayat, only adults go out for \nwork. Children do not go to work. Only persons from 18 years and above go to work with the consent of their family.\u201d \nSJPU members shared the sentiment, stating, \u201cDue to increased awareness among citizens, the number of child \nmarriages has decreased drastically.\u201d\nThe prevalence rate of boys who faced child labor was 18% whereas for girls it was 0.9%.\nThe highest number of child labor cases were estimated from the districts of West Bengal and Bihar- Gaya (boys \n30,305,9; girls 27 ,942); Murshidabad (boys 23,501,9; girls 983). These districts also had the highest prevalence \nrates (Gaya- boys 30.2%; girls 3%); (Murshidabad- boys 18.2%; girls 0.5%).\n\u201c\nChild labor persists, especially in brick kilns, factories, and sewing machines. \n\u2013 Community Stakeholder, West Bengal58 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nTable 3.3.3: Prevalence rates of Child Labour (CL) using NSUM (N=167)\nState Districts N\nTotal \nDistrict \nBoys (N)\nTotal \nGirls in \nDistrict \n(N)\nPrevalence \nrate of \nboys faced \nCL (%)\nNumber of \nboys faced \nCL in the \ndistrict  \n(N)\nPrevalence \nrate of girls \nfaced CL \n(%)\nNumber of \ngirls faced \nCL in the \ndistrict \n(N)\nBihar Gaya 18 1005066 943057 30.2 303059 3 27942\nRajasthan Dungarpur 17 332146 311020 8.2 27254 2.1 6617\nWest Bengal 24 Parganas North 24 813838 7 78518 18.5 150931 0.5 3604\nWest Bengal Murshidabad 83 1287912 1224145 18.2 235019 0.1 983\nWest Bengal Jalpaiguri 12 57663 0 555516 6.3 36306 0 0\nAverage 18 192078 0.9 6828\n3.3.2 Knowledge and Awareness of child labor\nA high proportion of mothers and children in West Bengal had received information on child labor. \n42.4% of mothers and 40.5% of children reported receiving information on child labor. The highest proportions of mothers \nto receive any information on this aspect were from the districts of West Bengal (Murshidabad 86.6%; North Parganas \n85.1%; Darjeeling 80.7%; Jalpaiguri 70.7%). Chandauli district (7 .8%) from UP and Barmer district (15.1%) from Rajasthan \nhad the lowest proportion of mothers who received information on child labor.  (Refer to T able A.4.1 in Annexure 4).\nThe qualitative findings from the focus group discussions reveal that children have a comprehensive understanding of \nthe detrimental effects of child labor. Their voices express a shared disapproval of this practice.\nOur field team used photo prompts depicting children engaged in work to children across states and found \nthat they were able to articulate that these children were being employed. In West Bengal (WB), one child \nstraightforwardly stated, \u201cChildren are made to work for money.\u201d  In Bihar, diverse perspectives emerged, \nwith some children suggesting that these children worked under compulsion, while others asserted that \nthe children did not wish to work but were forced to do so. The children\u2019s reactions varied, encompassing \nsentiments such as the desire to play, attend school, or support their families after school hours. Some Bihar \nrespondents highlighted that certain children spend their entire day in school and, after school, engage in \nwork to contribute to their family\u2019s well-being. One child from Bihar specifically mentioned that, as per their \nbook, a child below 18 years should not be engaged in work for monetary gain, categorizing such situations \nas child labor. Another poignant observation from Bihar highlighted a stark dichotomy: \u201cOne side is school \nand another side is Bricklin. We think the child is going to work in Bricklin instead of school. I feel bad for them \nbecause child labour is not good.\u201d  This sentiment reveals the child\u2019s strong awareness of the issue. In Uttar \nPradesh (UP), boys expressed a thorough understanding of the issue, emphasizing the importance of children \nattending school and studying instead of engaging in labor. One child advocated for education over child \nlabor. \u201cChildren should study instead of this. If they read, they will get a job somewhere and they can get better \nremuneration. \u201cAnother child remarked, \u2018\u2019 It is a crime.

A government official from the state explained its occurrence in garages, dhabas, and \nhotels. Similarly, a government official in Rajasthan shed light on the migration of children of working age \nto Ahmedabad and Gujarat during study breaks in pursuit of employment opportunities. An Anganwadi \nrepresentative in Rajasthan demonstrated awareness that children were compelled to work in shops, hotels, \nor as laborers, often facing exploitation with meager pay and long working hours. In Uttar Pradesh (UP), \ngovernment officials acknowledged the issue of child labor, defining it as the forceful engagement of children \nbelow 18 years in work. A Gram Panchayat representative from UP recognized the widespread nature of \nchild labor, citing its presence in industries such as \u201cBricklin, Dhaba, and hotels.60 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nMothers surveyed from West Bengal had greater awareness of laws related to protecting children from hazardous \nwork, as opposed to mothers from Rajasthan.\nNearly 30% of the mothers reported being aware of a law or regulation that protects children from working on \nhazardous work. Mothers surveyed from districts of West Bengal had the highest awareness on this aspect. 50-\n55% of mothers across all 4 districts of West Bengal were aware of a law or regulation that protects children from \nany work that is hazardous in nature (Jalpaiguri 55.6%; North Parganas 55.1%; Darjeeling 52%; Murshidabad \n51.2%). (Refer to T able A.4.5 in Annexure 4). The lowest awareness on this aspect was observed in Rajasthan. \nOnly 7-10% of the mothers reported knowing any law or regulation that protects children from hazardous work \n(Bharatpur 7 .1%; Dungarpur 8.8%; Barmer 5.4%; Jaipur 10.5%).\nPoverty was reported as the most prevalent reason for child labor by the majority of mothers across all 16 districts. \nUnder the baseline survey, more than 2/3rd of the surveyed mothers (76.3%) reported that poverty was one of \nthe many reasons why child labor prevails in the community. This was followed by other reasons such as death of \nparents (56.6%) and sickness of parents (41.6%). (Refer to T able A.4.6 in Annexure 4). \nIt is important to note that only 25% of the mothers reported that child labor exists because children drop out of \nschool. The lowest proportions of mothers from Chandauli (2.9%) and Prayagraj (4.1%) districts of UP reported \nthis reason. This low prevalence shows a lack of knowledge among mothers of the importance of education in \ncombating issues such as child labor in the community. (Refer to T able A.4.6 in Annexure 4).\nQualitative discussions with children, community and district level stakeholders also reveal poverty and economic struggles \nas causes for child labor. There are distinct yet interconnected narratives of the causes of child labor across states. \nIn West Bengal, the closure of tea gardens in Darjeeling led to economic struggles, making children vulnerable \nto labor. Insights from a NGO personnel highlight the impact, \u201cOut of 87 tea gardens in Darjeeling, 30 are closed, \ncreating poverty among the population, compelling children to enter the labor force.\u201d\nSimilarly, Bihar echoes a narrative of poverty-induced child labor, heightened by the economic repercussions \nof the pandemic. An NGO personnel in Bihar emphasizes, \u201cDue to Covid, many factories have been closed, \nmany people have lost their jobs, and most have become unemployed. Poverty is also a significant factor in \nthis area.\u201d Families, grappling with financial instability, are coerced into sending their children to work for \nsurvival. Another NGO personnel from Bihar reveals a stark reality, \u201cDaily wage laborers don\u2019t get much work \nduring flood time. MNREGA also doesn\u2019t give payment on time. So people don\u2019t trust MNREGA. And the mentality of \nlaborers is that they work for 10 days and rest for 4 days. In MNREGA, they don\u2019t get work. Poverty and ignorance \nare the main causes of child labor.\u201d\nIn Rajasthan, the surge in child labor is attributed to a lack of education and economic fragility. A government \nofficial in Rajasthan points out, \u201cIt is increasing due to a lack of education and economic weakness.\u201d Similarly, in Uttar \nPradesh, the allure of money forces poor parents to send their children as bonded labor. A NGO personnel in Uttar \nPradesh said \u201cParents are responsible for this. Due to poverty, they had to allow children to work as child labor.\u201dBASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 61\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nThe children\u2019s voices emphasize the interconnected challenges of poverty and the pressing need for education. Children \nalso expressed their views on the close connection between child labor, poverty, and family circumstances. \nOne child in Uttar Pradesh said, \u201cChild labor, poverty, not being able to go to school\u2014these are all connected. We \nwant to study and play, not work.\u201d A child from West Bengal echoed similar sentiments, \u201cNo, what is seen is that \nin most cases the family is a little poorer, and it is more common among children who do not go to school.\u201d\nIn the narratives that unfolded during the FGDs with children, a compelling and consistent theme emerged: a \nresolute and unanimous disapproval of child labor. Children from different states unanimously reject child \nlabor, emphasizing the importance of studying and acquiring education for a better future. In West Bengal, \nchildren express strong disapproval of child labor, emphasizing the need to focus on studies. A child from \nWest Bengal asserts, \u201cThis is not acceptable under any circumstances because at this age one should study.\u201d A child \nfrom Uttar Pradesh said, \u201cBy reporting, we can save their life, and they will again go to school for study.\u201d Children \nalso prioritize education over economic work, highlighting that children should study first before considering \nany work opportunities. However, in one exception case, some boys from Bihar believed that engaging in \nlabor allows children to meet their needs and acquire mobile phones.\n3.3.3 Attitudes and Beliefs on Child Labor\nFor both children and mothers, there is a scope to enhance awareness, attitudes and beliefs related to child labor \nassociated with children working in family settings.\nThe composite score for attitudes and beliefs of mothers related to child labor is the lowest in UP- Bareilly district \n(0.61), followed by Prayagraj (0.63). (Refer to table 3.3.4). \nLess than 50% of the mothers disagreed with the statement that children should work for their parents or relatives for free. \n67 .4% of the mothers agreed with the notion that there should be laws that punish individuals employing children in \nwork that is inappropriate for their age. T able 3.3.4 shows that, less than 50% of the mothers from Balrampur, Sitamarhi, \nand, Barmer agreed with the statement, showcasing a scope for improvement of beliefs in this aspect in these districts.\nThe composite score for attitudes and beliefs of children related to child labor is lowest in Barmer (Rajasthan) (0.55), this \nwas followed by Prayagraj (UP) (0.59) and Balrampur (UP) (0.62). Less than 50% of the children in Barmer disagreed \nwith the statement \u2018as long as it benefits the family, children should be allowed to do any kind of work\u2019. In Prayagraj, only \n33.4% of children disagreed with the statement \u2018If parents have no money, children should have to work anywhere\u2019  \n(Refer to table 3.3.5).62 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nOnly a small proportion (40.7%) of children across all 16 sampled districts disagreed with the idea that children \nshould work for free for their parents and relatives. As shown in T able 3.3, districts of UP and Rajasthan had low \npercentages of children who disagreed with the notion of children working for free for family and relatives, with \nthe lowest proportions in Prayagraj (9%) and Chandauli (5.4%).\nIt is important to note that there is a need and scope for enhancing the knowledge and awareness of mothers and \nchildren regarding the existence of child labor in family settings or disguised settings. \nA government official from West Bengal discussed presence of child labor in a disguised manner. The official \nnoted that there have been cases related to child labor that, upon closer examination, were identified and \nsubsequently addressed.\nThe perspectives of stakeholders, which included NGO personnel and the judiciary, portray a collective stance united \nagainst child labor. The NGOs emphasize the detrimental effects of child labor on human rights and education. Judicial \nrepresentatives recognize challenges in implementation and advocate for comprehensive plans to address vulnerable \nfamilies. NGO personnel believe in the critical role of financial harmony in successfully implementing child \nlabor laws. They also stress the importance of effective collaboration among police, inter-departmental \ncoordination, NGOs, and families to bring child labourers back on the right track. According to an NGO \nrepresentative in West Bengal, \u201cLaws can be successfully implemented only when there is financial harmony \namong all in society.\u201d NGO staff firmly believe in the negative impact of child labor on human rights, education, \nand the overall well-being of children. A NGO representative in Bihar stated, \u201cNo child labor is acceptable, and \nthere are several compelling reasons such as violation of human rights, impact on the education of children, physical \nhealth risk of the child, exploitation of children, impact on society, etc.\u201d NGO staff also strongly feel the need for \nchildren to study and play in a nurturing environment.Royal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nBASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 63\nTable 3.3.4: Attitudes and beliefs of mothers related to child labor (%) (N= 6560)30\nState District\nIf parents have \nno money young \nchildren should \nhave to work \nanywhere any \nkind \n(disagree)\nIt is good to start \nto work at early \nages \n(disagree)\nIf there is a work \nwith payment, \nthe parent \nshould force the \nchild to drop out \nof school and \nsend him/her to \nwork \n(disagree)\nChildren have to \nwork for free for \ntheir parents and /\nor relatives \n(disagree)\nWeaving/\ncottage \nindustry is a \nsimple job for \na child \n(disagree)\nAs long as children \nare paid, they \nshould be left \nto work outside \nhome \n(disagree)\nSo long as \nit is for the \nbenefit of \nthe family, \nchildren \nshould be \nallowed to \nwork \n(disagree)\nThere should \nbe laws \nthat punish \nindividuals \nemploying \nchildren in \nwork that is \ninappropriate \nfor their age  \n(agree)\nComposite \nscore related \nto attitudes \nand beliefs \nrelated to \nchild labor\nUttar Pradesh Balrampur 42.2 74.6 72.7 40.5 72.4 70 63.9 48.8 0.83\nUttar Pradesh Bareilly 27.3 65.9 77.3 40 73.2 76.3 70.7 75.4 0.61\nUttar Pradesh Prayagraj 83.7 92.9 95.4 41.5 62.9 96.8 93.7 71 0.63\nUttar Pradesh Chandauli 64.6 89 84.6 39 78.5 78 90.2 52 0.75\nRajasthan Bharatpur 77.1 98 99.8 12.7 95.9 100 100 86.1 0.84\nRajasthan Dungarpur 82 85.1 90.7 21.7 62 72.7 84.9 55.6 0.72\nRajasthan Barmer 70.7 92.2 85.6 66.1 91.7 87.1 82.4 26.3 0.87\nRajasthan Jaipur 84.6 96.1 99 26.3 90 99.3 98 90.2 0.84\nWest Bengal Jalpaiguri 84.6 96.1 94.1 68.3 81.7 91.5 84.1 64.9 0.69\nWest Bengal 24 Praganas North 84.6 91.2 94.4 44.4 78.3 96.3 87.3 89.5 0.88\nWest Bengal Darjeeling 92.4 87.3 98 63.9 84.4 96.3 93.4 80.5 0.85\nWest Bengal Murshidabad 69.5 95.4 92.9 32.7 76.1 92.4 83.7 82.2 0.83\nBihar Gaya 86.8 97.6 91 94.6 69.3 94.9 94.6 72.4 0.71\nBihar Sitamarhi 92.2 96.3 96.8 69.5 91 98.5 97.3 49.3 0.78\nBihar Darbhanga 81.2 92.9 91.5 76.1 82.7 95.9 96.8 52 0.80\nBihar Katihar 52.2 74.1 74.1 57.6 72.9 73.4 78.8 82 0.86\nT otal 73.5 89.1 89.9 49.7 78.9 88.7 87.5 67.4 0.78\n30.

(Refer to T able A.4.20 in Annexure 4)\nHowever, 51.4% reported that there were no negative consequences of child labor on other activities. This \nhighlights a greater need for awareness amongst children of the negative effects of working at a younger age.\nThe qualitative evidence on impact of child labor shows shared awareness on the harmful consequences of \nchild labor across states. In West Bengal, the impacts that emerge from the narratives include sex trafficking, \nbonded labor, and urban begging, with concerns about education and future outcomes. In Bihar, children \ndiscuss a range of consequences, from missed education to health issues including mental and physical \nhealth. Rajasthan\u2019s FGDs emphasize the loss of normal childhood experiences. In Uttar Pradesh, stakeholders \nuniversally recognize extensive negative impacts, with children enduring over 10 hours of daily labor.\nIn West Bengal, CWC officials acknowledge the diverse impact of child labor, ranging from sex trafficking \nin brothels to bonded labor in households and children begging in cities. An official in Jalpaiguri noted that \nchildren are stuck into labor-intensive jobs, leading some to succumb to drug addiction.\nFGD sessions with children in West Bengal highlight the detrimental consequences of child labor, particularly \nits adverse effects on education. Participants express concerns about the future of children engaged in child \nlabor, fearing they may be trafficked, drop out of school, or encounter challenges in pursuing their goals. One \nparticipant stated, \u201cThe future is bad.\u201d\nIn Rajasthan the narratives on adverse effects of child labor emerge from the FGD sessions with children, \nemphasizing that it deprives them of normal childhood experiences. One girl said, \u201cThese children are made \nto work in factories, hotels, beg, work at railway stations, and their kidneys are sold.\u201d\nIn Uttar Pradesh, all stakeholders acknowledge the negative impact of child labor. According to a CWC \nofficial, such children endure more than 10 hours of labor daily in exhausting environments.

This was followed by Gaya, Bihar (1.56%) (Refer to table 3.4.1). Mothers from various \ndistricts reported knowing no child who was a victim of child trafficking- Bareilly, Prayagraj, Chandauli, Bharatpur, \nDungarpur, Jaipur, Jalpaiguri, and Darjeeling. \nThe 50 mothers (0.76%) who reported that they knew at least one case of a child who got trafficked in the last \n1 year, were spread across only 23 villages (Refer to T able A.5.12 in Annexure 5). Therefore, out of the total 160 \nvillages where the survey was conducted, 135 villages had no reporting of any child trafficking cases.\nOn average mothers were aware of at least 1 boy who was trafficked in the last 1 year.\nStakeholders, during qualitative interviews, highlighted that the challenge of identifying victims and the \nhidden nature of the problem makes it difficult to gain an accurate picture of the trends and prevalence. They \nargued that although the exact figures are unknown, a government stakeholder added,  \u201cWe cannot say that \nthere are no such cases. But yes, there are fewer cases.\u201d \nOne of the reasons for the under-reporting of child trafficking cases highlighted through Interviews with \nkey informants, particularly government stakeholders, reveal that trafficking is often confused as child \nlabor, making the issue hard to recognize. Government stakeholders shed light on the dire situation faced \nby children. One emphasized, \u201cChildren themselves are not aware that they are trafficked, and they do not know \nfacts like where they are going, for what reason they are going, and so on. Sometimes the children are told that they \nare going to work, earning money. Their families are trapped and allured by the wicked people or intermediaries \nin the network of child trafficking.\u201d  Another government stakeholder drew attention to the hidden nature of \nthe issue, stating, \u201cIt\u2019s hidden cases and misled by love affairs, but it\u2019s rapidly increasing day by day.\u201d This \nstakeholder also pointed out the challenges in identification, adding, \u201cThe number is increasing in a hidden \nway, which is very difficult to identify.\u201d \nTable 3.4.2:  Average number of Child trafficking cases reported by the mother (N=50)\nState Districts N Boys Girls\nBihar Gaya 6 3 0.2\nBihar Katihar 1 2 0\nBihar Murshidabad 25 1 0.04\nBihar Sitamarhi 4 1 0\nRajasthan Barmer 1 8 10\nUttar Pradesh Balrampur 6 2 1\nWest Bengal 24 Parganas North 6 2 0\nAverage 50 1.72 0.38BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 73\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nTable 3.4.2 shows that the average case of trafficking known by mothers was more for boys, as compared to girls \n(Boys 1.72; Girls 0.38) (Refer to table 3.4.2). The maximum cases of child trafficking were reported by a mother \nfrom Khandail, Gaya, where she knew 10 boys who were victims of child trafficking. While the cases girls were \nlow, Para village from Barmer, had a mother who reported to know 10 girls who were trafficked in the last 1 year.\nThe highest prevalence rate of trafficking was estimated for Barmer (Rajasthan), where 83.3% of the girls were \ntrafficked, and 67% boys. However, it is important to note that only 1 mother from Bramer reported that they \nknew a child who was trafficked in the last 1 year (Refer to table 3.4.3). \nSecondary literature further highlights that there is often reluctance among victims of child trafficking to disclose \nvictimization or seek help, because of fear of retribution from the traffickers33 34. This leads to one of the biases \nof the Network-Scale up method which was discussed in the first section- transmission bias. Given child victims \nrefuse to disclose their identity, often leads mother not knowing that information about the children in the \ncommunity, because children in the community did not communicate this. \nLimitation in NSUM estimate for lower response rates-  N-SUM, methodologically, calculates the \nprevalence estimates using the census population of the subgroup in question (children aged 18 years and \nbelow, in the case of this study) While doing so, it does not account for the low response rate therefore making \nit challenging to draw reliable conclusions for very low response rates. \nOverall, stakeholders across the states indicated that issue of child trafficking is on a decline except for those \ndistricts that share borders with Nepal, where the issue persists. The states had varied responses regarding \nthe prevalence of child trafficking, with Bihar experiencing high rates, while Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and \nRajasthan reported lower occurrences. In Uttar Pradesh, Prayagraj stands out with almost no reported cases of \ntrafficking, as indicated by all the stakeholders interviewed. Although there is a decreasing trend in other districts, \nthose situated near the Nepal border, like Balarampur, continue to struggle with the issue of child trafficking. \nIn Rajasthan, government stakeholders assert that the number of cases is nearly negligible, with no reported \ninstances of child trafficking. Bihar faces a concerning situation, particularly in the Sitamarhi district, located near \nthe Nepal border, where the incidence of child trafficking is high. A government stakeholder in Bihar stated that, \n\u201cCases remained high in Sitamarhi but due to awareness, its number is decreasing. Being a border region, its \nnumber is high here compared to other districts. But we have targeted to decrease it in the future.\u201d \nTable 3.4.3: Prevalence Rates of child trafficking (CT) using NSUM (N=50)\nState Districts N\nTotal \nDistrict \nBoys (N)\nTotal \nGirls in \nDistrict \n(N)\nPrevalence \nrate of \nboys faced \nCT (%)\nNumber of \nboys faced \nCT in the \ndistrict (N)\nPrevalence \nrate of girls \nfaced CT \n(%)\nNumber of \ngirls faced \nCT in the \ndistrict(N)\nWest Bengal Murshidabad 25 1287912 1224145 12 148807 0.3 3060\nAverage 16.32 160335 3.38 21972\n33.

The most common source of \ninformation on this was reported to be Television.  The FGDs from children also validate that Television news was \nthe most common source of information. \nDistricts of West Bengal had the highest proportions of children who had received some information (North \nParganas 91.7%; Darjeeling 90.5%; Murshidabad 85.6%; Jalpaiguri 82.9%). Low proportions of children from \nSitamarhi (9.8%), Katihar (16.1%), and Balrampur (18%) knew about child trafficking. (Refer to table A.5.1 in \nAnnexure 5).  Th e findings suggest that there is a scope for increasing awareness of child trafficking amongst \nchildren in the community.\nThe most common source of information on child trafficking was reported to be Television (54.3%), peers/friends \n(55.2%), teachers/school (49.1%), and parents (47 .6%). Only 3% of the children reported NGO sensitization \nprograms as a source of information. 17 .4% of the children also reported community/group discussions, with the \nhighest proportion reported in districts of UP- Bareilly (63.8%) and Balrampur (55.4%).\nThe lowest proportions of children from all districts of West Bengal reported this option (Jalpaiguri 2.1%; North \nParganas 12.8%; Darjeeling 4.6%; Murshidabad 0.3%).\nThe qualitative findings reveal that children have good understanding of child trafficking, recognizing it as \nsituations where a child is exchanged for money. However, in certain cases, they identify it as child labour. \nSimilarly, both children and all stakeholders interviewed had good knowledge and awareness of child \ntrafficking issues. The Gram panchayat members are informed about the issue and reported no instances of \nchild trafficking in villages.\nRespondents identify illiteracy, poverty, and unemployment as the main factors for Child Trafficking though some \nvariation in factors emerged across states. Various states have distinct reasons for cases of child trafficking. In \nWest Bengal, a prevalent tactic involves luring girls into what appears to be love marriages, only for them \nto become victims of trafficking later on. The rise of social media and widespread mobile phone access has \nbeen implicated in facilitating such incidents.  In the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, regions that share \nborders with Nepal are grappling with the significant challenge of child trafficking. The proximity to the \nNepal border has intensified the issue in districts within these states, highlighting a critical concern. An NGO \npersonnel mentioned \u201cSitamarhi district is located on the border of Nepal. So, Bihar government and the \ndistrict administration are actively working to reduce the trafficking cases. The government is organizing \ndifferent program by involving the NGOs to reduce the trafficking cases in the district.\u201d BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 75\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\n3.4.3 Attitudes and Beliefs on trafficking of children \nMothers and children reported to seek support from Police, in case any child goes missing. \n84.4% of the mothers said they would report a case where the child is found to be missing or kidnapped. The \nhighest proportion of mothers from West Bengal reported this (North Parganas 95.9%; Murshidabad 95.6%; \nJalpaiguri 93.7%; Darjeeling 92.7%). The lowest proportion of mothers from Barmer (59.3%) district of Rajasthan \nstated that they would report a case of missing child. (Refer to figure 3.4.1)\nAs compared to mothers, a slightly higher proportion of children (91%) across all sampled districts stated that \nthey would report or seek help from someone in case any friend of theirs goes missing. In Prayagraj district of UP \nonly 77 .3% of children reported doing so. (Refer to table A.5.13 in Annexure 5)\n94% of the mothers reported that they would seek support from the police. Other sources of reporting such a \ncase was chosen by a small proportion of mothers- AWW/ASHAs (9.4%); child protection committees\u2019 members \n(3.9%); Juvenile police units (1.5%); NGO complaint cells/platforms (0.8%). (Refer to table A.5.14 in Annexure 5). \nChildren reported to the police (80%) and parents (55%) the most. Similar to mothers, a small proportion of \nchildren stated other options such as Juvenile police units (4.3%); child protection committee members (3.4%); \nNGOs (2.3%); NGO cells such as bachpan bachao aandolan (0.2%) to seek support from. (Refer to table A.5.15 \nin Annexure 5). \nDuring focus group discussions with children across all states, when presented with scenarios depicting \nchild trafficking, unanimous agreement emerged that such situations are deemed unacceptable under any \ncircumstances. The children expressed a strong belief that incidents of child trafficking should be reported to \nthe police, unanimously considered the primary choice. Teachers and parents followed as secondary options \nfor reporting. Notably, in the states of Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, children displayed a preference for \nreporting to NGOs.\nFigure 3.4.1: Mother\u2019s and children\u2019s attitudes on reporting a case or seeking help in case any child goes missing \n(%) (N= 6560) \n76 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\n3.4.4 Practices on child trafficking \n3.4.3.1 Migration of children in the past \nBalrampur district of UP had the highest reported prevalence of migration, whereas Bharatpur district of Rajasthan \nhad none reported. \n11.3% ( N =  7 4 3  o f  6 5 6 0 ) of the mothers reported that someone in their family has migrated in the past. 7% \nreported that the family members have migrated seasonally, and 4.3% migrated permanently.

On \nthe contrary, none of the mothers surveyed from the Bharatpur district of Rajasthan reported any incidence of \nmigration in the family. \nA comparatively higher proportion of mothers from districts of UP and Bihar reported migration of children from \ntheir families. \nOf those mothers who reported an incidence of migration in the family, 21.7% (N= 161 of 743) of them reported \nmigration of children from the family. The highest proportion of mothers from Katihar (Bihar) (46.4%), Bareilly \n(UP) (43.8%), Gaya (Bihar) (36%), and Balrampur (UP) (34.2%) reported that children from their families migrated. \n(Refer to table A.5.5 in Annexure 5).\nOverall, nearly 90% (n =145) of the mothers who reported that the children in the family migrated reported the \nsearch of employment as one of the top reasons for their migration. \nBalrampur (83.6%), Bareilly (100%), and Katihar (100%) had the highest prevalence of mothers who reported \nthat the children in their family had migrated in search of employment/better employment. (Refer to table A.5.15 \nin Annexure 5).\nA government stakeholder said, \u201cI have seen in my tenure that rescued children bring bangle boxes for their mothers \nor sisters from the destination.

The highest proportions were reported from districts of UP and Bihar- \nBalrampur (33.4%; n =137), followed by Bareilly (23.9%; n = 98), and Katihar (19.5%; n = 80). (Refer to table \nA.5.8 in Annexure 5). Of those mothers who reported plans for future migration, 43.8% (n = 228) reported that \nchildren from the family will migrate. In Bareilly, 64.3% of the mothers (n = 63) reported that their children have \nplans for future migration. (Refer to table A.5.9 in Annexure 5).\nInterestingly, 81.14% (n = 185) of the mothers who reported that their children have plans for future migration, \nstated one of their reasons for migration as employment opportunities. 100% of the mothers in Bareilly (n =63) \nand Katihar (n= 43) reported this.

The highest proportions of these mothers belonged from the districts of Bihar- Sitamarhi \n(8.2%); Gaya (2.2%); and Katihar (1.2%). \nOut of the 16 districts, mothers from 6 districts reported to know no child who was a victim of sexual abuse (refer \nto table 3.5.1). Therefore, out of the 160 villages, 129 villages had no reporting of child sexual abuse cases. (Refer \nto table A.6.13 in Annexure 6)\nObservations from the field during the survey highlighted that one of the reasons for the underreporting of \nchild sexual abuse cases was the reluctance of mothers to discuss such sensitive issues. They might be afraid of \nbeing judged or treated badly if they share their own experiences or talk about someone else\u2019s experiences. 35  \nConsequently, response rates to personal questions tend to decline as the sensitivity of the topic increases36 37 .\nKEY FINDINGS\n\u2022 1.2% (84) mothers reported knowing at least 1 or more children who were victims of child sexual \nabuse in the last year. \n\u2022 Out of the 160 villages, 129 villages had no reporting of any case of sexual abuse.\n\u2022 Only 6.5% of the mothers were aware of the POCSO act. \n\u2022 56.6% of the mothers reported that they have spoken to their children about sexual abuse, whereas \nonly 36.4% of the children reported that their parents have spoken to them about this. \n\u2022 The lowest proportion of children disagreed with the notion that- \u2018only girls are victims of sexual abuse\u2019 \n(22.3%) and \u2018most perpetrators of child sexual abuse do not belong to the child\u2019s family\u2019 (48.3%).\n35. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6983735/ \n36.

In all these three villages, a mother reported to know 3 boys \nand 3 girls who were victims of child sexual abuse.  (Refer to table A.6.13 in Annexure 6)\nT able 3.5.3 shows the N-SUM estimates of the child sexual abuse cases across the districts where the mothers \nreported knowing at least 1 child who was a victim of child sexual abuse. The highest prevalence rate of child \nsexual abuse was in Sitamarhi (Boys 2%; Girls 1.5%). \nAnother reason for a low response rate on child sexual abuse could be because of the Transmission bias of the \nN-SUM method. Some mothers may genuinely be unaware of any instances of child abuse. Child sexual abuse \noften remains hidden because children are scared to talk about their experiences. They worry about getting in \ntrouble or being judged. Children who face sexual abuse, also have a fear of retribution39 40. They fear what might \nhappen to them, and their families if they reveal the abuse. Therefore, in such cases, the respondents (mothers) \nwho are being interviewed are not aware of any such case in the community, which leads to low response rates \nfor such sensitive issues.\nTable 3.5.3 Estimates of Child sexual abuse by NSUM (N= 84)\nState Districts N\nTotal \nDistrict \nBoys (N)\nTotal \nGirls in \nDistrict \n(N)\nPrevalence \nrate of \nboys faced \nCSA (%)\nNumber of \nboys faced \nCSA in the \ndistrict (N)\nPrevalence \nrate of girls \nfaced CSA \n(%)\nNumber of \ngirls faced \nCSA in the \ndistrict(N)\nBihar Sitamarhi 33 901005 795738 2 17747 1.5 11841\nWest Bengal 24 Parganas \nNorth 14 813838 7 78518 0 0 2.6 19907\nAverage 4.04 34861 4.04 31822\nThe Qualitative data, particularly from Government officials present a contradicting picture on the prevalence of child \nsexual abuse- whether the cases are increasing or decreasing . Officials from DWCD, NGO, and CWC claim that \nthe number is increasing drastically. Some government officials claim that the frequency of these cases is the \nsame, but the number of cases only seems to be increasing because more of them are being reported now \ncompared to in the past. They estimate roughly, \u201c230 to 250 reports every year\u201d, whereas another official claims \nto have seen as little as only four cases in the past five years. Another batch of Govt officials, particularly \nrepresentatives from DLSU and DCPU feel the numbers are decreasing. According to Govt representative, \n\u201cthere is no question of increasing them and the government and administration people are working well behind this\u201d. \nAnother remarked, \u201cPeople become more aware now, so these types of cases have been decreasing.\u201d\n39. The fear of retribution or harm in the context of survey participation refers to individuals\u2019 concerns about potential negative consequences they might face if they \ndisclose sensitive information, particularly regarding the experiences of others. This fear can act as a significant deterrent, preventing individuals from openly sharing \ntheir knowledge or awareness of sensitive issues\n40. https://journals.publishing.umich.edu/sdi/article/id/1823/BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 81\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\n3.5.2 Knowledge and Awareness of Child Sexual Abuse\nMothers were slightly more aware of child sexual abuse, as opposed to children. Mothers from Rajasthan and \nchildren from Bihar had the lowest awareness.\nMore than half of the surveyed mothers (53.3%) mentioned that they were aware that children can be subjected \nto sexual abuse/ harassment. This proportion was low for all four districts in Rajasthan with Bharatpur district \nhaving the lowest prevalence (17 .6%) (Refer to T able A.6.1 in Annexure 6). A low proportion of children (35.6%) \nreported having heard of sexual abuse. The lowest proportion of children was from Chandauli (UP) (9%) and \nSitamarhi (Bihar) (9.3%) while the highest proportion was observed from North Parganas (West Bengal). (Refer \nto T able A.6.2 in Annexure 6). \nOnly 6.5% of mothers across all districts reported knowing about the POSCO Act (Protection of Children from \nSexual Offence). However, other government stakeholders had a good understanding of child sexual abuse and \nunderstood the significance of the POCSO act as well.\nIn districts Bharatpur (Rajasthan) and Katihar (Bihar) no respondents were aware of the POSCO Act. The highest \nprevalence was seen for the districts of West Bengal, Jalpaiguri, and Darjeeling with a prevalence of 24.9% and \n20% respectively.  (Refer to T able A.6.3 in Annexure 6). \nThe voices of children reflect an awareness of touch. The understanding extends to recognizing the details \nof physical contact in some children. \u201cIf our friends, our teachers hug us or shake our hands, then it is a good \ntouch,\u201d they express, highlighting a clarity that resonates in their definitions of good and bad touch. In Bihar, \na child succinctly defines good and bad touch during an IDI, \u201cGood touch refers to safe, appropriate physical \ncontact, like hugs from loved ones, promoting comfort and trust. Bad touch involves unwanted or harmful \ncontact, causing discomfort or fear, such as hitting or inappropriate advances.\u201d This comprehension extends \nto personal boundaries, with an acknowledgment that boundaries may vary, but intimate areas should not \nbe touched without consent. Yet, the narrative isn\u2019t uniform even within the state. In some Bihar FGDs, \nhesitancy emerges, with one interviewer expressing concern that \u201cthe students were not aware much and \nwere hesitant to speak on this. \u201cShyness becomes a barrier, as highlighted by another interviewer who notes, \n\u201cChildren know but feel shy to discuss.\u201d82 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nGovernment entities, such as the District Legal Services Authority in Bihar, demonstrate a good understanding \nof the issue. They recognize that child sexual abuse extends beyond physical trauma to intentional sexual acts, \ninappropriate remarks, and exploitation. They cite UNICEF statistics, emphasizing the prevalence of sexual \nabuse among adolescent girls and the significance of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act \n(POCSO) in combating such crimes.\nA government official points out that, \u201cTeasing girls, good touch or bad touch, or giving dirty glances, all this is \nchild sexual abuse.\u201d Another Government official said, \u201cChild sexual abuse (CSA), also known as child molestation, \nis a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent uses a child for sexual stimulation. Types of child sexual \nabuse include engaging in sexual activity with a child (whether by asking or forcing, or grooming a child in other ways), \nand child sexual abuse, such as using a child to make child pornography. Different types of child sexual abuse Child \nmarriage is one of the main forms of child sexual exploitation\u201d\nLess mothers were able to identify different actions, which constituted child sexual abuse.\nLess than 30% of the mothers across all districts, identified behaviors like pulling a child\u2019s clothes to expose their \nbody or underwear (21.3%), or someone showing their private parts to a child (20.8%) as child sexual abuse. This \nproportion was lowest for all four districts in Uttar Pradesh. (Refer to A.6.4 in Annexure 6).\nThe lowest identified behavior as sexual abuse by children was physical or verbal exposure to sexual intercourse \n(28.6% of children). This prevalence was lowest for district Katihar in Bihar (1.7%)\nKissing or touching the child forcefully was the most identified child sexual abuse behavior by mothers (68.8%) \nas well as children (82.9%). More than 90% of the mothers in districts Sitamarhi (Bihar) (96.3%) and Bharatpur \n(Rajasthan) (95.8%) identified the same (Refer to A.6.4 in Annexure 6). This prevalence was highest for children \nfor Jalpaiguri (94%) and Darjeeling (93.9%) districts of West Bengal.\nThese findings indicate a need for enhanced awareness among mothers as well as children in the sampled districts \nregarding child sexual abuse behaviours, particularly in UP .\nFigure 3.5.1: Understanding of child sexual abuse by mothers (%) (N)= 3501)\n68.8\n37.8\n20.8 21.3\n32.7\n5\n31.6\nKissing or\ntouching the\nchild forcefully\nSpying on the\nchild when\nthey are not\nfully dressed\nSomeone\nshowing their\nchild\nprivate parts to\nPulling child's\nclothes to\nexpose their\nbody\nunderwear or\nMaking sexual\ncomments and\ngestures\nPhysically or\nverbally\nexposing to\nhave sexual\nintercourse\nAll of the above\nUnderstanding of child sexual abuse by mothersBASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 83\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nThe perceptions of stakeholders present a disconcerting narrative on the broad spectrum of perpetrators. \nA Bihar official emphasizes the inhumane mentality of perpetrators. A West Bengal official notes that male \nelders, aged 55 and above, often family members, engage in crimes for money. Perpetrators extend to \nteachers, neighbours, and individuals like truck drivers, as highlighted by another West Bengal official. An \nNGO staff that fa revealed that familial perpetrators, particularly male elders, may resort to blackmail and \nthreats.\nOne government official from Bihar emphasizes the inhumane mentality among perpetrators, regardless \nfamilial ties, these individuals, as noted, can be found both within families and outside. The official states, \n\u201cThere are some inhumane people in society. They can be in the family or from outside.\u201d  Close relatives, such as \nuncles, maternal uncles, and neighbours, are frequently identified as the primary perpetrators of sexual abuse \nagainst young children by some authorities. \nAccording to a government official, minors, particularly those from illiterate families, may unwittingly become \noffenders due to a lack of awareness about legal actions and provisions. The official says, \u201cThey are not aware \nof the legal action, acts provision. They come from illiterate families.\u201d\nOne official believed that, male elders within families are reported to be engaging in these crimes in exchange \nfor money. A government official from West Bengal specifies, \u201cPredators are mostly men who are above the \nage of 55, who molest, rape, and are mostly family members.\u201d For some, Perpetrators extend beyond familial \ncircles to include teachers, neighbours, and individuals such as truck drivers, drug addicts, and criminals, as \npointed out by a government official from West Bengal. The lack of education is highlighted as an additional \nrisk factor.\nFigure 3.5.2: Source of Information on sexual abuse as reported by children (%); (N)= 2336)\n19.7\nParents Teacher  F riends Televsion\n69.4\n60.1\n41.1\n31.5\n0.1\nSocial\nMedia\nSiblings/\nCousins\nSource of Information on Sexual Abuse84 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nFriends, social media, and teachers were the most common sources of information for children on sexual abuse.\nFriends/acquaintances (69.4%) and social media (60.1%) were the top two sources from where children heard \nabout sexual abuse. A relatively lower proportion of children also reported hearing about the same from their \nparents (31.5%) and teachers (41.1%) or cousins/siblings (19.7%). (Refer to the T able A.6.5 Annexure table 6)\nA lower proportion of children confirmed that their mothers/parents had spoken to them about sexual abuse. \nMore than 55% of the surveyed mothers reported that they have spoken to their children about sexual abuse. \n(Refer to T able A.6.11 in Annexure 6). This proportion was highest for district Prayagraj (94.2%) in Uttar Pradesh. \nAs compared to mothers a relatively lower proportion of children across all districts reported that their parents \nhave ever talked to them about sexual abuse (36.4%).  Refer to Table A.6.6 Annexure 6). Interestingly, for children \nas well, the highest proportion was noted from district Prayagraj (59.1%). \nMore than 50% of the surveyed children reported that they have been told about sexual abuse at school or by \na teacher (52.3%) (Refer to T able A.6.7 Annexure 6).

The highest proportion of mothers across all districts advised children \nto not go out with strangers (79.3%). This proportion was high for all the sampled districts in Uttar Pradesh and \nRajasthan with all mothers in Bharatpur (100%) discussing the same. The lowest proportion of mothers from \nMurshidabad (West Bengal) (47 .3%) discussed this with their children. \nApart from this a relatively lower proportion of mothers (44.8%) across all districts reported teaching their \nchildren about good touch and bad touch. This percentage was lowest for districts Balrampur and Bareilly where \nonly 3.7% and 0.9% of mothers respectively reported the same  (Refer to Table A.6.14 in Annexure 6).. The other \ndiscussion points reported by mothers with lower proportions include discussions around not letting anyone \ntouch private parts (24.9%), encouraging the children to speak about such incidents if any, not keeping any secrets \n(28%), providing them with books or audio-visual aids for sexual abuse prevention (12.2%) (Refer to Table 3.5.4)\nAs being aware of the existence of sexual abuse, helps children understand what it is and recognize inappropriate \nbehaviour, the findings suggest a scope for more discussions between children and their mothers regarding the \nsame.  \nOne government official remarked, \u201cSomewhere the family system is also at fault. In society, if people keep their \nchildren well informed and aware, and keep them within the boundaries of culture, then it will have a positive impact.\u201d \nMany believed that families serve as the first school for many young children, shaping their norms and culture \nas they grow up.

Government officials, \nNGOs, and community stakeholders contribute diverse insights, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of this \npervasive Child Sexual Abuse issue.\nCSA is linked to various societal issues, as one government official mentions, \u201cChild sexual abuse is \nconnected due to lack of socialization, parenting, family background, psychological disorder, lack of humanity, \npsychological issues, revenge, sex addiction, pornography.\u201d \u201cAnother official points to the impact of technology, \nemphasizing that the main reasons for child sexual abuse include the widespread availability of phones.\u201d A government \nofficial shared that the societal trend among young teenagers to elope and run away exacerbates the issues \nof child sexual abuse. A government official from Uttar Pradesh expressed, \u201cGirls run away with boys, and they \nare brainwashed. This happens through chatting also.\u201d  Social media addiction, increased demand, and mental \ndisorders are also highlighted as contributing factors. \u201cThe main reasons for child sexual abuse in today\u2019s society \nare internet, mobile facility, every person in every house having a phone and leaving the phone in the hands of children. \nIn this way, teenage girls become victims.\u201d\nIn Bihar, officials identify drugs and poverty as the primary reasons for child sexual abuse. According to an \nofficial, the lack of resources at home leads girls to vulnerable situations, such as \u201cgoing to farms for nature\u2019s \ncalls, making them targets for perpetrators\u201d. The lack of fear instilled in potential offenders is also recognized as \na cause.\nIn Rajasthan, the narrative expands to attitudes and beliefs. An NGO representative attributes the increase \nin child sexual abuse to societal stigmas and the lack of open conversations about sex and sexuality. They \nemphasize the impact of conservative thinking and avoidance of open discussions on sex-related topics, \npushing children towards seeking information on the internet, where negative content often dominates. \u201cThe \nreason behind this is the mentality of the people... If you write the word sex, you will get 10% good things and mostly \nnegative things, then instead of that 10% coming to the child\u2019s attention, 90% comes to the child\u2019s attention, and the \nchild will try to try things in a wrong way.\u201d\nGovernment officials from Uttar Pradesh attribute child sexual abuse to a combination of factors. They point \nto bad mentality, the influence of modern technologies, readily available offensive online content, and love \naffairs of girls as contributing elements. Teenage love affairs are highlighted as a major reason, and the lack of \nsurveillance and monitoring of children\u2019s mobile phone usage is emphasized.BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 87\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\n3.5.3 Attitudes and Beliefs related to Child Sexual Abuse\nOverall, the attitudes concerning sexual abuse amongst mothers highlighted a scope for greater awareness and \nshift in attitudes, especially in the context of beliefs around sexual abuse education.\n|Overall, across the 16 sampled districts, the composite score for attitudes on sexual abuse for mothers was 0.40. \nOnly 28.2% of the mothers reported disagreeing with the notion that child sexual abuse prevention education \nmay induce your child to know too much about sex (Refer to T able 3.5.5). The composite score for attitudes and \nbeliefs of mothers related to child sexual abuse is lowest in Bharatpur (0.17). The highest compositive score was \nobserved from Murshidabad (0.71). \nA high proportion of mothers across all districts agreed with the notions that Child Sexual Abuse prevention \neducation in school is necessary (92.8%), Body safety rules (good touch/bad touch) should be taught to the \nchild at primary level (91.7%) and Strict legal punishment will create prevention of Child sexual abuse (90.7%). \nHowever, a relatively lower proportion of mothers from Darjeeling (West Bengal) agreed with these statements \nshowcasing positive attitudes. (refer to Table 3.5.5)\nAcross all 16 districts, the lowest proportion of children disagreed with the notion that- \u2018only girls are victims of \nsexual abuse\u2019 (22.3%) and \u2018most perpetrators of child sexual abuse do not belong to the child\u2019s family\u2019 (48.3%). That \nis the maximum, agreed with these notions, showcasing a need for shift in attitudes and beliefs in this regard. (refer \nto Table 3.5.6)\nIt can be observed that a high proportion of children across all districts reported believing that Educating children \non sexual abuse is necessary to prevent Child Sexual Abuse (95.3%), Child sexual abuse prevention education \nshould be a part of the school curriculum (96.3%) and Child sexual abuse prevention education should be a part of \nthe College curriculum (95.5%). Across all the sampled districts, a very low proportion of children disagreed with \nthe notion that only girls are a victim of sexual abuse. This proportion was lowest for 24 North Parganas (West \nBengal) where only 7 .5% of children disagreed with the same, showcasing the need for improvement in attitudes \nin the district. \nA high proportion of children across districts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar agreed with the notion that youth can \nplay a big role in preventing Child Sexual Abuse in their locality.

Secondary literature further \nshows that parents and caregivers might not fully understand the digital platforms and social media sites that their \nchildren use. As a result, they may not be aware of potential dangers or how to navigate online privacy settings.45\nSocial stigma: Similar to cases of child sexual abuse, children often don\u2019t disclose their experiences of online \nsexual abuse. In some cultures, discussing issues related to sexual abuse can be considered taboo. Victims may \nfeel societal pressure to keep such incidents secret to avoid judgment and preserve the family\u2019s reputation. 46 \nTherefore, this leads to a transmission bias, where mothers are not aware of such incidents happening in the \ncommunity, for them to further report it.\nThe government and NGOs both acknowledge the issue of OCSEA. A government stakeholder emphasized, \n\u201cIt is one of the pressing issues we are currently confronting,\u201d showcasing the gravitas of the problem and \nawareness about the issue. \nIn West Bengal, concerns regarding the increasing prevalence of online child sexual exploitation and abuse \n(OCSEA) were shared by both government and non-government groups. Non-government organizations \nemphasized the underreporting of cases despite a discernible increase, while government officials linked \nOCSEA to a surge in suicides and drug abuse. In Bihar, conflicting views emerged, with NGOs asserting a \nrise in cases linked to increased social media use. Acknowledging the rising trend, a government stakeholder \nstated, \u201cYes, the number of child trafficking cases is increasing. In my opinion, there are several reasons behind it. For \nexample, the easy availability of mobile/smart phones to children and their unrestricted access to information and \nundesired content on the internet. Televisions and other viable mediums can also be factors for the same.\u201d\nThis contrasted with the perspectives of government, local leaders, and school managers, who credited strict \nlaws and heightened parental awareness, claiming either a decline in numbers or a lack of observed cases. \nRajasthan witnessed a consensus among stakeholders who asserted a decrease in OCSEA cases, with a \nnotable emphasis on robust awareness programs. Uttar Pradesh exhibited a divergence of opinions among \nstakeholders on the prevalence of OCSEA, with some pointing towards underreporting due to familial \nprestige, yet local authorities believed in a downward trend. \nIn Uttar Pradesh, stakeholders also differed on the prevalence, with some citing underreporting due to the \nprestige and reputation of families. Interestingly, the gram panchayat and School Management Committees \n(SMCs) in Uttar Pradesh expressed a belief that OCSEA cases were decreasing.94 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\n3.6.2 Practices related to the usage of the internet in the household\nMurshidabad (96.8%) and North Parganas (95.1%) in West Bengal had the highest percentage of households \nwith smartphone and internet access. \nMore than 75% of households had smartphones available in their households.

While more than 90% of the households in North Parganas (West Bengal) had internet within the \nhousehold, only 82.7% of the mothers reported that their children also had access to the internet.

((Refer to table A.7 .9 in Annexure 7)).\nDifference in responses of mothers and children on monitoring internet usage were observed.\nA high percentage of mothers (89.6%) reported that they supervised their child\u2019s internet usage by just going \nto the child and checking their device to see what they were doing on it.  While in most districts, 80% or more \nmothers reported doing this, a few exceptions were Darbhanga (Bihar) (69.3%), North Parganas (West Bengal) \n(76%), Jalpaiguri (West Bengal) (76.3%), Chandauli (UP) (79.5%), and Murshidabad (West Bengal) (79.2%). Similar \nto mothers, a high percentage of children (62.2%) reported that parents used to come and check their devices to \nsee what they were doing. (Refer to Annexure A. 7 .27).\nAnother commonly reported monitoring mechanism was associated with setting up rules in the household to limit \nthe number of hours of internet usage (Mothers 17 .5%; Children 23.9%). A few other methods of supervising \ninternet usage were limiting the rules for which the internet can be used (mothers 15.7%; children 9%) and \nthe use of software/filters that monitor what the child sees online (mothers 10.2%; children 17 .6%) (Refer to \nAnnexure A. 7 .27).\nAll stakeholders perceived parental irresponsibility and lack of supervision as the primary drivers. The misuse of social \nmedia, pornography addiction, easy access of mobile phones & internet, are also stated as causes. \nIn the assessment provided by stakeholders, parents consistently emerge as the main figures responsible for \nthe inadequate supervision of their children\u2019s internet activities. This perspective is rooted in various factors, \nincluding concerns about the misuse of social media, the rise of pornography addiction, and the prevalence of \nmobile phones and internet access.\nOne government stakeholder emphasized, \u201cIt\u2019s rapidly increasing. The cause is due to phone addiction, social media \nsharing explicit content, and children being technology friendly. It\u2019s difficult for parents to track their mobile phones, \nonline games, and social media. This gives children an easy mode of communication and the opportunity to earn.\u201d\nThe improper use of social media is a notable concern, including problems like inappropriate online interactions, \nexposure to harmful content, and the risk of online bullying. Another concern is pornography addiction, where \nparents are seen as essential in tackling this challenge. Since explicit content is easily accessible on the internet, \nthere\u2019s an expectation that parents should play an active role in supervising and regulating their children\u2019s \nonline activities to shield them from age-inappropriate materials. Adding to these reasons, a member from a \nlocal community said, \u201cParents, busy earning a living, often don\u2019t keep an eye on their kids. Nowadays, everything is \nonline, and parents can\u2019t always tell if their kids are studying or just wasting time.\u201dBASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 97\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\n3.6.3 Knowledge and Awareness on Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation\nA relatively higher proportion of children (50.3%), as compared to mothers (46.2%), reported that the internet can \ncause a threat to privacy and security. \nThe baseline survey defines privacy and security in the following way:\nPrivacy: Assurance that the confidentiality and access of certain information related to a person is protected.\nSecurity: State of being protected against the potential threats and dangers over the internet.\nThe highest proportions of mothers from West Bengal- Murshidabad (88%) and 24 Parganas North (83.7%) \nreported that as per their view, the Internet can cause a threat to privacy and security of an individual.

Students admitted witnessing abuse, particularly for incomplete homework or disruptive behaviour. \nStakeholders assert the absence of corporal punishment but believe occasional displays of authority is necessary.\nPrevalence: The perspectives on the prevalence of corporal punishment among children exhibited significant \nvariation. While one participant openly acknowledged personal experiences of witnessing corporal punishment \nin both school and at a coaching center, another group of children presented a contrasting viewpoint. The \nchild expressed, \u201cWe have never seen or heard of this happening, neither in our school nor anywhere else.\u201d\nHowever, amidst this diversity of perspectives, some students within the same group admitted to witnessing \nsuch abuse, particularly when a child failed to complete homework or behaved disruptively in the classroom. \nThis was articulated through statements like, \u201c Especially when we forget to do our homework or are untidy in \nschool, violating rules of the school. Sometimes even when teachers come into the classroom with anger and grudges, \nthey pour their anger onto students.\u201d \nDespite these observations, when prompted for details about specific instances of abuse, the students clarified \nthat they had never witnessed incidents involving the cutting of a child\u2019s hair within the school setting. One \nchild stated, \u201cI have seen in my school when children do not turn in their homework and when someone indulges in \nbullying. I have not seen children getting their hair cut.\u201d\nKnowledge and Awareness: Looking at the photo prompts, the children consistently noticed a pattern \u2013 \nteachers giving punishments to students. \u201cThe teacher is beating the student,\u201d remarked one child, highlighting \nthe harsh reality of corporal punishment . Another child observed, \u201cThe teacher is doing hair cutting.\u201d \nGovernment and non-governmental stakeholders show a collective awareness of corporal punishment. They \nare well-versed in procedures and regulations related to incidents of corporal punishment. In the focus group \ndiscussions, children offered rich qualitative insights into the factors they believe contribute to incidents of \ncorporal punishment. A prevailing theme in their discussions was the perception that these incidents often \nstem from students making mistakes or engaging in disruptive behaviors. As one child put it, \u201cPerhaps they \nmight be causing disturbance in the class or not doing any homework, etc.\u201d\nA distinctive aspect highlighted by the participants was the association between students\u2019 appearances \nand disciplinary actions. The children mentioned instances where students had their hair cut as a form of \npunishment, with one child stating, \u201cChildren\u2019s hair is cut when they have long hair.\u201d  Furthermore, deviations \nfrom prescribed grooming norms, such as not braiding hair, were identified as specific triggers: \u201cIn this picture, \nthe girls have not braided their hair, hence the teachers are cutting their hair.\u201d Children also mentioned that \u201cpainting \nnails\u201d and \u201ccoloring hair\u201d could also lead to disciplinary consequences. \nAcademic performance emerged as another notable factor linked to disciplinary measures. The children \nconveyed a belief that not completing homework or forgetting it could lead to punitive actions. This sentiment \nwas captured in statements like, \u201cIt happens when we do not do some homework or do not remember it, and it is for \nour good\u201d and \u201cWhen children do not study, teachers scold them.\u201d\nThe children also acknowledged the emotional state of teachers as a contributing factor. They expressed an \nunderstanding that teachers might vent their anger onto students. As one child explained, \u201c Sometimes even \nwhen teachers come into the classroom with anger and grudges, they pour their anger onto students.\u201dBASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 111\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\n3.7.2.2 Safe School\nA. School Attendance\nOf the total sampled children, 88.7% (n = 5821) were enrolled in school, and 11.3% (n = 739) were not currently \nenrolled in school. 17 .6% (n = 129) of the children who were not enrolled in school, reported that they had never \nattended school ever. The remaining 610 children did not complete their education. \nThe most reported reason for not completing school was to work in order to help the family financially.\nThe highest percentage of children from Katihar (Bihar) reported this (64.8%; n = 46). Shortage of money for \nschool materials/transportation and school dress was also reported to be one of the reasons for not completing \neducation by 32.5% children. The highest percentage of children who could not afford to continue going to school \nwere from Uttar Pradesh (Balrampur 42.2%, n = 65; Chandauli 61.8%, n= 21; Bareilly 42.1%, n= 61; Prayagraj \n34.8%, n= 42.1%).(Refer to table A.8.15 in Annexure 8) \nIt is interesting to note that, 15.6% of the children (n= 95) also stated that their parents did not want them to attend \nschool.

School Facilities\nA relatively higher number of children from the districts of Bihar reported a lack of separate and clean toilets for \nboys and girls. \nSeparate toilets for boys and girls- The majority of the children reported that they had access to separate toilets for \nboys and girls at school. In districts of Bihar- Darbhanga (91.9%) and Katihar (92.7%), a relatively lower proportion \nof children reported having separate toilets for boys and girls. (Refer to table A.8.17 in Annexure 8)\nClean Toilets- A relatively lesser percentage of children stated that the toilets were clean at school (85.8%).

Systems for School Protection and School Safety Initiatives\nThe prevailing sentiment regarding punishment, particularly corporal punishment, was resolute \u2013 it should not be \nadministered at all.\nWhile some children acknowledged that teachers might resort to scolding or punishment for the welfare of the \nchild, a unanimous agreement emerged against the acceptance of excessive punishment. One child succinctly \narticulated this viewpoint, stating, \u201cChildren should not be beaten or punished too much because children do not \ncommit any mistake intentionally.\u201d Beyond the rejection of excessive punishment, there was a shared belief in the \neffectiveness of a more compassionate and nurturing approach to discipline. One child said, \u201cChildren can also be \nexplained with love. If the child still does not understand, then it is necessary to talk to their parents.\u201d\nMoving to seeking help in the face of corporal punishment, the children demonstrated a proactive stance. One \nchild emphasized this proactive mentality, stating, \u201cIf this is always happening, then the child should complain about \nit to the teacher or his principal or his family\u2019s guardian.\u201d  The hierarchy for lodging complaints included parents, \nheadmasters, and, in certain cases, seeking assistance from higher authorities if necessary.\nIn instances where a child acknowledged fault, there was an acceptance of apologizing. However, a clear \ndemarcation was drawn between taking responsibility for one\u2019s actions and enduring severe corporal punishment. \nSMC Officials highlight optimistic school environments with child protection awareness, yet gaps remain in \naddressing issues such as child sexual abuse and underutilization of complaint boxes.\nSMC officials contribute to a generally optimistic portrayal of school environments, particularly noting awareness \nsessions on child protection issues prevalent in most states, excluding UP . These sessions are credited with \nfostering vigilance and self-awareness among students, encouraging them to report cases, and acting as a \npreventive measure against issues like child marriage. Notably, discussions on child sexual abuse or online child \nsexual abuse are reported as lacking in certain regions.\nStakeholders noted that most schools have a complaint box, but officials say it is needed and unused as children \nprefer to complain verbally or through parents. \n3.7 .3 Macro Level\nFrom our FGDs and Interviews, we attempt to comprehensively understand the engagement of various \nstakeholders in the child protection landscape. Organizing this section within the 4 P\u2019s framework \u2013 prevention, \nprotection, partnerships, and prosecution \u2013 is pivotal for a holistic overview.\n3.7.3.1 Prevention\nMost states prioritized prevention through education, intertwining children with government schemes. The DWCD \nshielded with education, while the ICDS counselled on responsible digital activities. The DCPU adopted a multi-\npronged approach, and another state focused on cultural preventive measures against child marriage.114 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nIn Uttar Pradesh, the Department of Women and Child Development (DWCD) aimed to create a safety net for \nchildren through education. A representative stated, \u201cThe mission was not merely linking children with schools but \nintertwining them with government schemes. Education served as the shield, the prevention strategy.\u201d Additionally, the \nIntegrated Child Development Services (ICDS) in Uttar Pradesh proactively counselled children and parents on \nresponsible mobile and online activities. An official explained, \u201cCounselling was done if any such incident came to \nnotice. We advised children and parents about the use of mobiles and online activities.\u201d\nIn Bihar, the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) took a multi-pronged approach with extensive awareness \ncampaigns, meetings, hoardings, and the formation of Child Protection Committees (CPC) at the block and \npanchayat levels. The NGO sector in Bihar collaborated with women\u2019s and children\u2019s groups, forming CPCs in \nmultiple panchayats. A representative stated, \u201cWe kept making the children aware of the legal rights they had through \ncamps. We worked at the social, institutional, and administrative levels to strengthen the Child Protection Committee in \nthe entire district.\u201d Rajasthan stood out for its cultural understanding in preventive measures against child marriage, \nwith awareness campaigns on Akha Teej using puppet shows and street plays.\nDespite initiatives aimed at generating awareness, gaps persist in addressing child protection issues, with \nstakeholders in multiple states citing a pervasive lack of knowledge as a significant challenge.\nA government official in West Bengal stated, \u201cNo increase in cases; all stakeholders were able to work, but due to a lack \nof awareness or failing to make people more aware of the process, reporting and identifying the abuse remained an area \nto work on.\u201d Another government official from West Bengal highlighted the interconnected challenges of poor \nawareness, substance abuse, poverty, and societal norms, stating, \u201cLog kya sochey ga\u201d (\u201cWhat will people think\u201d). \nIn Bihar, an NGO representative attributed the surge in child labor cases to poverty and a lack of awareness, \nstating, \u201cIn the district, poverty and lack of awareness were the major reasons for increasing child labor.\u201d Another NGO \nin Bihar emphasized the lack of awareness among girls as the primary reason for the growing number of child \nsexual abuse cases. Furthermore, a government official from Bihar characterized the district as an outsourcing \npoint for child labor due to the guardians\u2019 lack of awareness and education.\nIn Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh also government officials drew attention to the vulnerability of children in rural \nareas due to a lack of awareness, knowledge, and poverty. In Uttar Pradesh, one official mentioned, \u201cIn the absence \nof proper knowledge and information, children took wrong decisions due to which girls or boys had to face several problems.\u201d\n3.7.3.2 Protection\nProtection measures were robust across states\nIn Uttar Pradesh, collaborative efforts between the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) and the police, \nparticularly in cases involving children with disabilities, facilitated legal aid. Child Welfare Committees (CWC) played \na vital role in rescue and rehabilitation. West Bengal\u2019s Department of Women and Child Development and Social \nWelfare (DWCD&SW) implemented child welfare schemes, with active NGO participation in rescue operations. \nIn Dungarpur, Rajasthan, a comprehensive approach involving government entities, NGOs, and CWCs protected \nchildren through shelter and specialized care. Bihar\u2019s Missing Track Portal streamlined information on missing and \nrescued children, enhancing protective interventions. Across states, swift activation of protection systems upon \nreceiving child-related news was highlighted, with prompt intervention from local administration and law enforcementBASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 115\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nDiverse child mental health services are implemented across states, ranging from the provision of one-on-one \ncounselling to post-rescue support and art therapy.\nMental health services offered to children varied. In West Bengal, officials mentioned providing one-on-one child \ncounselling, while in Bihar, the focus was on post-rescue counselling to help children overcome mental trauma \nand prevent relapses into harmful environments. Art therapy was employed, and awareness programs were \norganized to educate communities about mental health. A Bihar official explained, \u201cWhen children were rescued \nfrom the brothels, they had this mindset of going back to the same place or profession because of the fear that their \nparents wouldn\u2019t accept them or no one was going to marry them, so we offered counselling.\u201d \nReporting hurdles compound child protection issues: some face hesitancies, others advocate urgency, and there are \nstruggles with online abuse awareness gaps\nIn West Bengal, parents\u2019 hesitancy to file General Diary (GD) entries led to delays and withdrawals, exacerbating \nthe under-reporting of child trafficking cases. A West Bengal official emphasized, \u201cChild trafficking exists in the \ndistrict but is under-reported.\u201d \nThe gravity of reporting was underscored in Bihar during a focus group discussion where participants expressed \nthe importance of reporting child trafficking and labor cases. They asserted, \u201c Yes, it is important. It should be \nreported. If not reported, the child will spoil his/her future life.\u201d  However, the challenge persisted as a government \nofficial in Bihar shed light on the limitation in their information network, stating, \u201cWe only get those cases that are \nreported. We do not get information about those cases which are not reported.\u201d\nThe issue extended to online child abuse cases, as acknowledged by government officials in both Bihar and Uttar \nPradesh. A government official in Bihar noted, \u201cWe have not had any cases of online child abuse so far,\u201d emphasizing \nthe lack of reported cases. Similarly, a government official in Uttar Pradesh stated, \u201cOnline child sexual abuse cases \nare also very rare in our district. Cases are not reported.\u201d Despite efforts such as organizing workshops on cybercrime, \ngovernment officials in Uttar Pradesh expressed frustration at the scarcity of reported cases, indicating a \nsignificant gap in awareness and reporting. \nThe absence of ID proof, coupled with weak monitoring, creates hurdles in accessing child protection services.\nUttar Pradesh officials shed light on the uphill battle in proving offenders\u2019 minor status due to protracted legal \nprocesses. Families, often uninformed about available legal support, may not pursue cases diligently. A poignant \nstatement from a Uttar Pradesh government official reveal, \u201cTo prove that the offender is a minor (under 18 years \nold) is one of the key challenges. Sometimes children appear older due to the time-taking process of legal provisions.\u201d\nThe process of documenting cases of child labor and ensuring the effectiveness of government welfare schemes \nin Uttar Pradesh encountered substantial hurdles linked to identification proof. An official emphasized, \u201cDuring \nthe field visits, I realized that government welfare schemes were not reaching the desired beneficiaries due to several \nreasons. One of the reasons was that eligible beneficiaries either didn\u2019t possess required/necessary documentary proof or \ndidn\u2019t have proper information for relevant schemes.\u201d116 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nMoreover, the absence of strong monitoring and awareness compounded the situation. Street children, who frequently \nmigrated without any identity proof, added another layer to the challenge. The official further explained, \u201cStreet children \nwere also found in the district. They usually migrated from one place to another without holding any identity proof.\u201d\nRehabilitating rescued children poses complex challenges including certificate issues, follow-up gaps, and lack of \ncomprehensive plans.\nThis challenge was exemplified by an experience shared by the NGO personnel when he was actively addressing \nchild labor issues. He recounted, \u201cI would like to share one of our experiences a few years back when we were working \non child labor issues. Some children were rescued in another state by our team effort. For the rehabilitation of the children, \nthe issuance of certificates from that area/district was required by the district administration/concerning department.\u201d  \nThe complexity intensified in areas that posed challenges or sensitivity regarding children\u2019s deployment in labor \nwork. This sentiment was echoed by an NGO in West Bengal, emphasizing the absence of a comprehensive \nrehabilitation plan. In Bihar, another government official raised concerns about the lack of proper follow-up on \nchild labor cases, creating the potential for rescued children to return to labor work. \nInfrastructure deficiencies impede child protection measures: absence of shelter homes, inadequate office space, \nand transportation constraints.\nIn Uttar Pradesh, the effective implementation of child protection measures faced significant impediments due \nto the shortage of space, transportation, and infrastructure. A government official in Uttar Pradesh lamented, \n\u201cThere was a lack of vehicles, transportation, and infrastructure.\u201d\nThis deficiency was further highlighted by a government official\u2019s statement regarding the major gap in the child \nprotection ecosystem in the district. They emphasized the absence of shelter homes for girls and boys, stressing \nthe need for safe environments. \nAn NGO representative in Uttar Pradesh added to the concerns, citing the inadequacy of office space. They stated, \n\u201cThere was no proper space in the office. We could just make a letter and could do work somehow, but we did not have sufficient \nspace for keeping the records and doing work in a proper way. The senior officer(s) engaged DCPU staff in other works.\u201d\nInsufficient resources hinder support for rescued children in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Government officials in \nUttar Pradesh and Bihar voiced frustrations over insufficient resources, impeding their ability to address the \nbasic needs of rescued children. \nFunding constraints significantly impacted the functioning of past organizations dedicated to child welfare. Another \nrepresentative expressed the challenge, stating, \u201cYes, the lack of funding for organizations like us. We were not able \nto work as per the need. We organized events by paying from our pockets most of the time.\u201d The collective frustration \nunderscores the urgent requirement for increased past financial support to enable more comprehensive past \nchild welfare initiatives.\nNGO staff unveil knowledge and training gaps particularly at the Gram Panchayat level\nNGOs in Rajasthan and Bihar have consistently stressed the imperative need for improved training to effectively \ncombat online child exploitation and enhance the knowledge of stakeholders, particularly at the Gram Panchayat level.BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 117\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nIn Bihar, NGO personnel discussed the urgency of enhancing the knowledge of Gram Panchayat-level stakeholders. \nA representative from Bihar NGOs reflected, \u201cThere was still a lot of need for improvement, and the professional \nhijackers were very big experts. If you became an expert here by doing very small courses, then there was a need \nfor a lot of improvement in this.\u201d This reiterated the need for comprehensive training and expertise to effectively \naddress online child exploitation.\nOfficials grapple overwhelming responsibilities. They advocate for specialized approaches.\nOfficials in Bihar openly shared the challenges posed by overwhelming responsibilities, advocating for specialized \nroles to ensure more effective child welfare. A heartfelt plea from a government official in Bihar reflected, \u201c The \nmost important challenges for us are that if any person is associated with any case or the responsibility he has, then he is \nnot responsible for just one thing.\u201d \nHighlighting operational challenges, a government official in Rajasthan shed light on the struggles faced during work \nhours. \u201cYou could clearly notice the flaws. There were five of us. We were here from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. There was nowhere we \ncould go to eat. There was nowhere for relaxing down. We had meetings regularly. We had to accomplish this and that.\u201d \nPoor constitution and limited functionality of Child Protection Committees (CPCs) across states - Data reveals stark \noperational rates .\nOur team gathered data on the functioning of Child Protection Committees (CPCs) across four states. In Bihar, out \nof 40 villages, CPCs were formed and functioned in only 4 villages. These villages were Rasulganj urf Koili, Khairwan \nMalahi, Ghurghura Hanumannagar urf Ghurghura Baluaha, and Sarkhandio Bitha. The partner organizations \ncollected this data by consulting with the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU), other relevant departments, and \nofficers. They also spoke with social workers from their organizations who operated in these villages.\nIn Uttar Pradesh, out of 40 villages, 30 villages had CPCs, presenting a more positive picture. However, out of the \n30-plus CPCs formed, only 3 were functioning. The partner organizations obtained this data by engaging with \nthe DCPU, relevant departments, and officers in Uttar Pradesh.\nIn West Bengal, CPCs were established in all 40 villages, but unfortunately, not even one was functioning. Our \npartner organizations collected this information by consulting with the DCPU, Block Development Officers, and \nsocial workers operating in the villages in West Bengal.\nUnfortunately, we could not access the CPC data for Rajasthan through our partners.  This was due to a change \nof government after the recent election and the subsequent change of officials in relevant departments.\nMental health support challenges - stakeholders advocate \u2018mind-washing\u2019, highlight resource shortage.\nChallenges existed, as highlighted by Bihar officials, who stressed the importance of regular \u201cmind-washing,\u201d \ncounselling, and training by mental health specialists to address the \u201cfear\u201d and \u201cmindset\u201d of rescued children.  \u201c  A \nUP official highlighted the lack of resources to offer mental health services.\nDespite acknowledging the urgency and significance of mental health interventions (as discussed earlier in section \n3.7 .1.2) the stakeholders did not provide detailed insights into specific strategies or structured frameworks \nin place. This lack of granularity raises questions about the comprehensiveness of their understanding and \nimplementation of effective mental health support. 118 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\n3.7 .3.3 Partnerships\nStakeholders emphasized past successful child protection initiatives, highlighting key elements such as streamlined \ncommunication, a collective approach, and structured collaboration. Nationwide, effective coordination \namong various departments, regular district-level meetings, and the potential consequences of negligence were \nunderscored, emphasizing the critical importance of coordinated effort.\nStakeholders have consistently emphasized the significance of partnerships, highlighting coordinated efforts \namong government departments, NGOs, and the judiciary. A government official from Uttar Pradesh emphasized \nthe success achieved through interdepartmental coordination, noting, \u201cOur child protection success came from \nstreamlined communication and regular meetings among administrative departments.\u201d\nInsights from a government official in Bihar revealed a structured approach, stating, \u201cIn Bihar, the Juvenile \nJustice Board, Child Welfare Committee, and District Child Protection Unit worked collaboratively, ensuring a \ncomprehensive effort for all children.\u201d\nSimilarly, in Rajasthan, a government official highlighted practical coordination, stating, \u201cThere was good \ncoordination between everyone. We contributed our part, providing assistance when needed in our collaborative \nchild protection efforts.\u201d\nFurthermore, stakeholders emphasized the regular and periodic meetings held at the district level among related \ndepartments and officials. The awareness of the necessity of convergence was evident, with a government official \nfrom West Bengal stating, \u201cWe can destroy children\u2019s life if we don\u2019t coordinate well, we can\u2019t compromise our \nwork for leisure.\u201d\nNegligence or lack of convergence was acknowledged to have serious consequences, as highlighted by an NGO \nrepresentative from West Bengal: \u201cNegligence of their activity or lack of convergence would not bring justice; the \nprocess would make it worse for them and might as well lead to harassment.\u201d\nExclusion and coordination challenges affect community stakeholders. \nThe coordination challenges within child welfare initiatives present a complex scenario, with most stakeholders \nnoting the absence of significant coordination gaps. However, specific challenges have been identified by certain \nstakeholders. A community representative from Bihar expressed a lack of collaboration with other stakeholders \nin the state, stating, \u201cWe work independently mostly. Yes, we do not have coordination with any agency or \ndepartment. We work for *****management. We are isolated within the system.\u201d\n3.7 .3.4 Prosecution\nLegal aid and support are crucial in addressing child online abuse, with a systematic approach in play.

This multi-layered process ensured a comprehensive and discreet handling of online abuse cases. \nSystemic issues and oversight challenges result in delayed justice for child abuse cases \nIn Rajasthan, a representative from an NGO shed light on the challenges faced by children in receiving timely \njustice. The representative emphasized that the investigative process played a crucial role in the delay of justice \nfor child abuse cases. They stated, \u201cSee, it remained that whatever cases of children were investigated, due to the gap \nin investigation, children faced difficulties in getting justice or there was a delay in getting justice. All these problems \narose due to the investigation; the deeper the investigation, the easier it would be, but sometimes due to the delay in \ninvestigation, there was a delay in getting justice.\u201d\nA government representative highlighted a critical gap in the implementation of justice at the ground level. They \nexplained, \u201cBut it was not implemented at the ground level. People\u2019s awareness about the enacted law is important.\u201d \nDespite having laws in place, there existed a disparity in ensuring their effective application to aid children in a \ntimely manner.\nDespite grappling with significant challenges and complexities, officials and community representatives \ndemonstrate remarkable resilience. They effectively navigate the situation by strategically prioritizing victim \nsupport and community empowerment amidst diverse pressures.\nBihar officials highlighted significant challenges stemming from political pressure and threats, impacting victim \ntestimonies and investigative processes. A candid admission from a Bihar IDI, CWC representative revealed, \u201cThe victims \nare pressured into saying that they are not involved in any wrongdoings, and they identify the perpetrators as their families.\u201d\nThe official continued, expressing concerns for investigators and witnesses, \u201cWhen we go to those places, we also \nget scared of seeing their homes, and after coming to our workplace, there is also pressure to leave the perpetrators.\u201d The \nclandestine nature of such cases, including hiding children underground, further complicates investigations and \nexposes investigators to potential risks.\nAnother perspective from a government official in Bihar emphasized the challenges faced by social workers, \nstating, \u201cSince the sevika is a social worker, she is also social. Yes, she belongs to the same community, so if you suddenly \nbecome against anything, then the entire society will go against you.\u201d  The delicate balance between spreading \nawareness and potential backlash within the community poses additional challenges for those engaged in child \nwelfare efforts.4\nRECOMMENDATIONSBASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 121\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nRecommendation 1- Target attitudes and behavior of parents towards willingness to \nreport child protection issues: \nThe overall response rate of parents throughout the study indicates lack of willingness to \nreport child protection issues. Future interventions should target community members \n(particularly parents) with a focus to improve their willingness to report such incidents. \nParents play a critical role in enabling or disabling the prevalence of child protection issues. In \nmany cases they are involved in the act and in other cases they are not willing to report due to \nstigma, reputation, or fear of further harm. For instance, parents themselves include children \nin work from early age and do not see how it effects their education (an overall development). \nThese attitudes are a key roadblock in bringing these issues to light and they must be targeted \nbefore actual behavior and practices can be improved.   \nEvidence/Rationale for the recommendation: Survey found very low proportion of \nmothers willing to report incidents of child marriages in their community with only 13% \nagreeing to report in future incidents. Similarly, 35% of the mothers indicated unwillingness \nto incidents of child sexual abuse. During the data collection several enumerators reported \nidentifying children who are currently married but their mothers were not willing to \nacknowledge the same. While for child labor, 18% children reported working during the \ntime of survey. Majority of the children reported working in own household related work/\nbusiness. 122 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nRecommendation 2- Improve awareness and attitudes on key child marriage issues: \nThe study shows several gaps in knowledge around child marriage issues among mothers. \nIt is recommended to target communities towards improving their knowledge in child \nmarriage indicators like legal age of marriage (especially of boys), negative effects of child \nmarriage, etc. Evidence shows misinformation and misplaced beliefs around benefits of \nearly marriage which enables parents to get their children (especially daughters) marry early. \nFuture intervention should target spreading correct and wholistic knowledge around child \nmarriage. It should also ensure discarding misinformation around benefits of child marriages.   \nRecommendation 3- Advocacy for creating social protection for children from \nvulnerable groups who lose their primary caretaker:\nEvidence from the studies shows that children (specially for vulnerable groups) are \ncompelled to work due to the death of primary earner. Future intervention should aim for \nadvocating for social schemes from government which provides protection to children in \nsuch an adverse event. Allowing for their education to continue and not burdening them with \nthe responsibility to earn for family.  \nEvidence/Rationale for the recommendation: 10% of the children and 7% of the mothers \nreported less than 21 years as the legal age for marriage for boys. Mothers reported that \nthe believe early marriage provides protection to girls with only 45% disagreeing with the \nstatement \u201cthat marriage provides physical and financial safety to girls\u201d. Additionally, 6.5% \nmothers reported that community prefers girls should get married early.  \nEvidence/Rationale for the recommendation: 56% of mothers reported that death of \nfamily members as they key reason for why a child is compelled to work.

Future intervention should aim \nto increase knowledge around how working early negatively affects studies, playtime, time \nwith family/friends etc. And why these are important for that age. \nRecommendation 5- Improve correct knowledge of what constitutes Child Trafficking:\nThe study indicates community stakeholders are not able to clearly distinguish the difference \nbetween child trafficking and child labor. Data shows a smaller proportion of children and \nmothers have received information on child trafficking. This is one of the key reasons why \nstakeholders are not able to identify and report an incident of trafficking. We anticipate this also \nwould have influenced the responses on witnessing child trafficking during the survey since they \nwere not fully aware of what can be categorized as trafficking. Future intervention should focus \non imparting the correct knowledge of child trafficking and how to identify such cases.   \nEvidence/Rationale for the recommendation: 63% of children reported that they don\u2019t think \nwork affects any areas of their life. While 44.5% reported that their timely with family and \nfriends is reduced due to work and only 9% felt that work does reduces their time for studies \nEvidence/Rationale for the recommendation: Interviews with key informants, particularly \ngovernment stakeholders, reveal that trafficking is often confused as child labor, making the \nissue hard to recognize. stakeholders explained that child trafficking is primarily confused \nwith child labor, leaving victims often unaware of their trafficking status. Government \nstakeholders shed light on the dire situation faced by children. One emphasized, \u201cChildren \nthemselves are not aware that they are trafficked, and they do not know facts like where \nthey are going, for what reason they are going, and so on. Sometimes the children are told \nthat they are going to work, earning money. Only 40.7% of the children reported that they \nhad received information on child trafficking.124 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nRecommendation 6- Improve knowledge of child sexual abuse: \nEvidence from this study shows a large proportion of mothers and children have not heard of \nsexual abuse. Mothers also lack complete understanding of what can constitute sexual abuse. \nThe majority were able identify it with physical actions like forcefully kissing or touching. But \nonly a small proportion were able to mention showing private parts, or pulling their clothes \nto expose them etc. Knowledge of important provisions like POCSO is significantly low, \nreflecting poor knowledge and understanding of sexual abuse. Future interventions should \ntarget improving the knowledge of community members about what all constitutes sexual \nabuse, what are the provisions and laws for the same. \nRecommendation 7- Improve parent\u2019s agency and ownership to supervise children\u2019s \naccess and usage of internet.\nThe evidence from this study shows a large proportion of children accessing the internet \nbut relatively smaller percentage reported that their parents supervise their online activity. \nAccessing social media was the most reported activity by children. This makes children more \nvulnerable to online abuse and threats. It is important that guardians actively monitor children\u2019s \nonline activities. Future intervention should target parents to improve their knowledge on \nonline supervision and enable them to safeguard children\u2019s access to online activities. \nEvidence/Rationale for the recommendation:  46% of the mothers reported not being \naware of the possibility of children can be subjected to sexual abuse/ harassment. While \nonly 35.6% of children reported that they have heard of sexual abuse. Only 6.5% of mothers \nacross all districts reported knowing about the POSCO Act (Protection of Children from \nSexual Offence). \nEvidence/Rationale for the recommendation: 43.6% of mothers reported not supervising \nand monitoring their child\u2019s online activities. In qualitative interactions too. All stakeholders \nperceived parental irresponsibility and lack of supervision as the primary drivers for online \nabuse and vulnerability of children. The misuse of social media, pornography addiction, easy \naccess of mobile phones & internet, are also stated as causes. Around 33% of mothers and \nchildren don\u2019t perceive any threats to privacy and security from the internet.BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 125\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nRecommendation 8- Improve knowledge of parents on legal provisions and focus on \nincreasing access to documents for marginalized community: \nEvidence from qualitative interactions shows that families are often poorly informed about \navailable legal support, may not pursue cases diligently. Further they are also not aware of \nmany welfares schemes they might be eligible for. Many don\u2019t have the required documents \nto avail benefits under schemes. Future interventions should focus on improving knowledge \nand access to legal provisions and welfare schemes by the community members. This also \nrequires focusing on helping people get necessary documents. \nRecommendation 9- Focus on operationalizing child protection committees at the \nvillage level: \nEvidence from 160 villages covered in this study shows most of the child protection \ncommittees (CPCs) in these villages are not operational. In several villages the committee \nis yet to be formed.  CPCs play a critical role in reducing child protection issues at the \nvillage level. Since they are comprised of community members who are affluent, they are \nmost aware of what prevails in the village and have a strong buy-in by the village residents. \nIntervention should focus on making these CPCs operational and ensuring these committees \nmeat periodically. Further, the CPCs should be leveraged for village level activities to ensure \na more sustainable effort to curb child protection issues. \nEvidence/Rationale for the recommendation: Based on information gathered from \nqualitative interactions with various government officials, NGOs and community members. \nEvidence/Rationale for the recommendation: In West bengal CPCs were established in \nall the 40 villages covered in the study but it was not operational in any village. In the case of \nBihar only 4 CPCs were formed and functioning (out of 40) while in Uttar Pradesh this 30 \nCPCs were formed but only 3 were functioning. No data was available for Rajasthan. 5\nCONCLUSIONBASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM | 127\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nThe baseline study of the KAWACH program aimed to draw findings to highlight the current child protection \nscenario in the selected 16 districts. 6560 mothers and children, along with various community-level, NGOs, and \ngovernment stakeholders participated in the study to provide meaningful insights on the prevalence, knowledge, \nattitudes, and practices of 5 key child protection issues outlined below. This section provides an overall conclusion \nof the baseline study.\nChild Marriage: The low N-SUM prevalence of child marriage shed light on the underreporting and already existing \nawareness among mothers. It was found that efforts from governmental and non-governmental organizations \nmay have made the community aware of the leading legal implications associated with it, which could have led \nto more filtered responses. Beliefs like the elopement of children and societal pressures were highlighted as key \nreasons for early marriage in the communities, showcasing a scope for a shift in beliefs. \nAdditionally, there were also gaps in beliefs associated with marriage and its association with the financial and physical \nprotection it provides to a girl. Attitudes towards reporting further highlighted a concerning normalization of child \nmarriage among mothers, in contrast to the more proactive stance of children. Practices around child marriage \nshowcased an extremely small part of the sampled children being currently married. However, the persistence of \ndowry practices across all districts calls for continued efforts to address deep-rooted societal norms.\nChild Labor : The prevalence of child labor was low, with significant regional variations, particularly high \nprevalence in West Bengal and Bihar. Underreporting was evident, attributed to the concealment of child labor \nin family assistance roles. Poverty and death of parents or guardians emerged as the primary factors contributing \nto child labor.  \nFindings on attitudes reflected a concerning acceptance of children working for relatives showcasing the existence \nof child labor in disguise settings. Still, there was a simultaneous recognition of the importance of education, \nespecially among boys during the FGDs. Reporting tendencies were relatively high as opposed to child marriage, \nhighlighting mothers\u2019 and children\u2019s willingness to report to authorities, particularly the police. However, seeking \nsupport from child protection committees or NGOs remained low, signalling potential gaps in awareness or trust.\nPractices revealed that more children self-reported to be currently working, as opposed to mothers acknowledging \nthis, which indicated underreporting. Fears of trafficking, dropping out of school, and hindrances in pursuing \nfuture goals highlight the urgency of addressing this issue.\nChild Trafficking: The prevalence of child trafficking was significantly low, highlighting the underreporting of \nissues by mothers. The underreporting was primarily due to confusion between child trafficking and child labor, \nshowcasing a gap in awareness amongst the community regarding what exactly constitutes as child trafficking. \nThere was a gap in awareness and attitudes towards reporting or seeking help from important members of the \nchild protection ecosystem-CPCs, and NGO personnel. Migration amongst children for employment activities \nwas reported, where mostly family members and friends facilitated their move, highlighting the need for change \nin practices. \nAwareness efforts, particularly in regions with lower knowledge levels, and targeted interventions addressing \nmigration for employment can enhance prevention and support mechanisms.128 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nChild Sexual Abuse: The prevalence of CSA remained low, and reasons for underreporting were social norms \nand transmission bias, with children not disclosing abuse experiences to their mothers. This outlined a gap in the \nattitudes and beliefs of the community members concerning the social stigma and norms related to sexual abuse. \nFindings on knowledge draw attention to the awareness gaps within the community, especially children.  The \ndata on mothers\u2019 knowledge and the limited conversations they did with children around CSA, highlights the gap \nin mothers\u2019 awareness levels and the need for greater parental involvement. Children\u2019s responses on attitudes \nhighlighted their stigmatized beliefs on only girls getting sexually abused and generally strangers are abusers of \nsexual abuse. \nIn conclusion, addressing CSA requires awareness strategies to combat the challenge of deep-rooted social norms \nand stigma. Additionally, parents need to realize their role in initiating conversations around sensitive issues such \nas CSA.\nOnline Sexual Abuse and Exploitation: Of all the issues, the lowest prevalence was reported for online sexual \nabuse. The findings highlighted the lack of mothers\u2019 awareness of what their children do on the internet, qualitative \nfindings also highlighted the prime reasons for OCSEA as lack of parental supervision. Correct identification of online \nsexual abuse among mothers was also low. And fewer mothers reported discussing the issue with their children. \nIn conclusion, Knowledge gaps exist, and attitudes toward reporting need improvement. Strategies should focus \non raising awareness, enhancing parental supervision, and educating both parents and children on online safety.\nOther Key Findings: A protective ecosystem for children requires an interconnected approach, addressing \nissues at micro, meso, and macro levels. The findings reveal various challenges and opportunities within each \nlevel of the ecosystem.\nAt the micro or individual level, children\u2019s agency was limited. Mental health concerns among children were also \nprevalent, emphasizing need for seeking help from mental health experts. While a majority had someone to turn \nto for support, there were variations in their perspectives on seeking help for issues like child sexual abuse and \ncorporal punishment.\nMoving to the meso level, instances of corporal punishment in schools were reported, highlighting the need for a \nshift towards more compassionate disciplinary approaches. \nAt the macro level, challenges in child protection initiatives were identified, including underreporting, lack of \nawareness, and problems in age verification and rehabilitation processes.  Infrastructure challenges and funding \nissues persist. Coordination among stakeholders was reported as crucial, and delays in legal processes and \npolitical pressures were reported as gaps in bringing justice to child abuse cases.\nOverall, a holistic and collaborative approach that involves the active participation of individuals, communities, \neducational institutions, and policymakers, along with strategies focusing on increasing awareness around \ndifferent child protection issues is essential. Additionally, a need for change in beliefs around social norms and \nstigma, and the practices associated with it is necessary to create a protective ecosystem for children and ensure \ntheir well-being and development.  \n6\nANNEXURES130 | BASELINE EVALUATION OF THE KAWACH PROGRAM\nRoyal Blue Golden Yellow\nCMYK 100, 98, 25, 10\nRGB 44, 47, 113\nHEX 2C2F71\nCMYK 15, 40, 100, 0\nRGB 215, 157, 41\nHEX D99D29\nThis section includes fact sheets (Data on key indicators) for all 16 districts of the 4 states wherein data collection \nwas conducted \u2013 Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and West Bengal.

The consent outlined the following 5 key points: \n \n\u2022 Voluntary Participation: It was ensured that individuals were not \ncoerced or unduly influenced to participate in the study. They had \nthe freedom to make independent decisions based on their \njudgment and without any external pressures. \n \n\u2022 Confidentiality: Participants were assured that their personal \ninformation would be protected and kept confidential. They were \ninformed that their identity would be anonymized or \npseudonymized, and their privacy would be respected throughout \nthe study. \n \n\u2022 Risks: When explaining risks in the informed consent process, \nclear and comprehensive information was provided to participants. \nThe enumerator discussed steps that would be taken to minimize or \nmitigate the identified risks and explained the safety measures, \nmonitoring procedures, or safeguards in place to protect \nparticipants from harm. \n \n\u2022 Benefits: It was important to present benefits in a balanced and \nunbiased manner, using clear language and avoiding any undue \ninfluence or exaggeration. Participants were provided with a \nrealistic understanding of the potential positive outcomes and were \nable to weigh them against the potential risks involved. \n \n\u2022 Withdrawal: The enumerator clearly stated that participants had \nthe right to withdraw their consent and discontinue their \ninvolvement in the study or procedure at any time without \nproviding a reason. Emphasis was placed on the fact that there \nwould be no negative co nsequences or penalties for withdrawing, \nand their decision would be fully respected and supported. \nDo Not Harm \n \nThe principle of non-maleficence is sacrosanct to avoid harm to the \nhuman subjects of the research, both through acts of commission \nand omission.  \n \nExtensive training of the field enumerators with clear instructions \nfor engagement and exit strategies in case of even perceived harm \nduring data collection was ensured. \n 212 | P a g e \n \nRespect and Justice \nThe principle of respect implied valuing humans, including children \nand their lived realities. It required recognition that their decisions \nexisted within a broader personal, relational, social, cultural, legal, \nand environmental context. The study team re ceived \ncomprehensive training on professional research ethics to \nguarantee the following: \n \n\u2022 Open-mindedness: They approached the issue with an open \nmind, avoiding assumptions or judgments and acknowledging that \ntheir perception might differ from that of the stakeholders. \n \n\u2022 Respectful Inquiry : They asked the appropriate questions in a \nrespectful manner, ensuring that the respondents' perspectives \nwere valued and considered. \n \n\u2022 Mitigation of Bias : The team actively avoided personal biases, \nincluding cultural biases, that could influence the data collection \nprocess, maintaining objectivity and impartiality. \n \n\u2022 Handling Emotional Reactions : They were equipped with \nstrategies to navigate interviews or surveys in situations where \nrespondents exhibited varied emotional reactions, ensuring \nsensitivity and appropriate handling of such instances. \nPrivacy & \nConfidentiality  \nAll participants were assured of the confidentiality of any \ninformation they share, and care was taken to protect the \nparticipants\u2019 anonymity through the use of anonymized \ninterviewee codes for each respondent, ensuring that the \nrecordings were uploaded onto the Cloud and not shared over \nemail, and ensuring that only the evaluation and field team had \naccess to the recordings and transcripts 213 | P a g e \n \n \nAnnexure 14: Evaluation Implementation Plan \n \nThe evaluation implementation was organized into three sequential phases of work, with the distinct \nactivities that were undertaken in each phase briefly outlined in T able A.5.1 below. \nT able A.14.1: Phases of Evaluation Implementation \nPhases Activities Deliverable \nPhase I: \nInception \nPhase \nInitial Virtual Kick-off Meeting and Desk Review: The project \ninitiation involved a virtual kick -off meeting to set the \ngroundwork, coupled with a thorough desk review aimed at \ngaining a comprehensive understanding of the context and \nspecifics of the program under consideration. \nDiscussion with BAT T eam: In the subsequent phase, in -depth \ndiscussions were conducted with relevant BAT (British Asian \nTrust) staff to gather insights into the program's intricacies, its \ngoals, and the various stakeholders involved, ensuring a well -\nrounded understanding of the project. \nFinalization of Evaluation Design:  The evaluation design \nphase encompassed the culmination of key elements, including \nthe methodology to be employed for a baseline evaluation, the \nsampling strategy to ensure representative data, and indicator \nmapping as well as finalization. This comprehen sive process \naimed to establish a robust framework for the subsequent \nphases of the evaluation. \nInception \nReport \nPhase II: \nData \nCollection \nFormulation, translation, and digitization of tools:  \nQuantitative and qualitative baseline evaluation tools were \ncreated for each stakeholder, in consultation with the BAT \nteam. The final tools were then translated into local languages \nHindi & Bengali, ensuring accessibility and comprehension for \ndiverse populations, and facilitating effective communication \nduring the data collection process. \nIRB approval, testing the research tools, \nenumerator/researcher training, and field data collection : \nThe project proceeded with obtaining Institutional Review \nBoard (IRB) approval, then transitioning to testing the tools to \nidentify and address any potential issues. Subsequently, \ncomprehensive training was provided to the enumerators and \nqualitative researchers by the core research team of Athena, \nwhich prepared them for the field data collection phase, which \ninvolved gathering information from the designat ed study \nareas. \nData collection and monitoring: The baseline quantitative and \nqualitative data collection was conducted in the month of \nOctober 2023. In-depth data monitoring was done by the core \nresearch team of Athena, where daily debrief calls were \nconducted with the field teams to gather field insig hts and \nchallenges during the data collection. \nFinal \nquantitative \nand \nqualitative \ntools, along \nwith \ntranslations 214 | P a g e \n \nPhase III: \nAnalysis and \nReporting \nData analysis and report writing : Following the completion of \ndata collection, the project entered the phase of data analysis, \ninvolving the examination and interpretation of the gathered \ninformation. This process included employing statistical \nmethods, qualitative coding, or other relev ant analytical \ntechniques, with the aim of deriving meaningful insights from \nthe collected data. Simultaneously, the initial stages of report \nwriting were undertaken to document the analysis process and \nkey findings. \nFinalisation of evaluation report:  The project concluded with \nthe meticulous finalization of the evaluation report. This phase \ninvolved synthesizing the results of the data analysis into a \ncomprehensive and cohesive document. The evaluation report \nencapsulated the entire research process, presenting findings, \nconclusions, and recommendations in a format suitable for \ndissemination to stakeholders.
